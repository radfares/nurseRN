Statistical technique in review
The levels of measurement were identified in 1946 by Stevens, who organized the rules for assigning numbers to objects so that a hierarchy of measurement was established. The levels of measurement, from lowest to highest, are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Fig. 1.1 summarizes the rules for the four levels of measurement that are described in the following sections.

A diagram shows four measurement scales with increasing properties from nominal to ratio. The diagram shows four vertical blocks labeled nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, arranged from left to right in increasing height. The nominal block lists exhaustive categories and exclusive categories. The ordinal block adds ranked categories. The interval block adds equal interval categories. The ratio block includes absolute zero in addition to all features in the previous blocks. Each block contains the full list of properties from the ones before it.

SUMMARY OF THE RULES FOR THE LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT.

Nominal and ordinal levels of measurement
Variables measured at the nominal level of measurement are at the lowest level and must conform to the following two rules: (1) the data categories must be exclusive (each datum will fit into only one category) and (2) the data categories must be exhaustive (each datum will fit into at least one category). Nominal level data might also be called categorical data, which means the values are names for categories but not real numbers ( Table 1.1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). For example, the variable medical diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is measured at the nominal level and includes two categories, yes has HF or no HF. HF is an example of a dichotomous or binary variable that has only two possible values (see Table 1.1 ). Variables measured at the nominal level that are frequently described in studies include gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, and medical diagnoses. For some nominal variables, such as medical diagnoses, some study participants might check more than one category because they have more than one medical diagnosis ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

MEASUREMENT CONCEPTS

Concept	Other Name	Description
Dichotomous	Binary	The variable has only two possible values.
Nominal *	Categorical	Values are names or categories, not real numbers.
Continuous	Ratio	Values use the real number scale, including the values between numerals.
Discrete		Numeric values used are not continuous.
Ordinal level of measurement includes categories that can be rank ordered; like nominal-level measurement, the categories are exhaustive and mutually exclusive (see Fig. 1.1 ). In ranking categories of a variable, each category must be recognized as higher or lower or better or worse than another category. However, with ordinal level of measurement, you do not know exactly how much higher or lower one participant’s value on a variable is in relation to another participant’s value. Thus variables measured at the ordinal level are discrete, meaning they do not have a continuum of values with equal distance between them like variables measured at the interval and ratio levels ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). For example, you could have study participants identify their levels of acute pain as no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, or severe pain. Pain is measured at the ordinal level in this example because the categories can be ranked from a low of no pain to a high of severe pain; however, even though the participants’ levels of pain can be ranked, you do not know the differences between the levels of pain. The difference between no pain and mild pain might be less than that between moderate and severe pain. Thus ordinal-level data have unknown, unequal intervals between the categories, such as between the levels of pain ( Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Nonparametric analysis techniques
Nonparametric or distribution-free analysis techniques are conducted to analyze nominal and ordinal levels of data to describe variables, examine relationships among variables, and determine differences between groups in distribution-free or non-normally distributed samples. The measure of central tendency, which is conducted to describe variables measured at the nominal level, is the mode or the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. The median or middle value in a dataset is calculated to describe variables measured at the ordinal level (see Exercise 8 ). Descriptive statistical analyses, such as frequencies and percentages, are often calculated to describe demographic variables measured at the nominal and ordinal levels in a study (see Exercise 6 ). Range is calculated to determine the dispersion or spread of values of a variable measured at the ordinal level (see Exercise 9 ).

Chi-square analysis is calculated to examine differences in variables measured at the nominal level (see Exercise 19 ). The Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient is calculated to examine relationships among variables measured at the ordinal level (see Exercise 20 ). The Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests can be conducted to determine differences among groups when study data are measured at the ordinal level (see Exercises 21 and 22 ). Nonparametric analyses are also conducted when interval- and ratio-level data are not normally distributed. The process for determining normality of a distribution is presented in Exercise 27 . More information about conducting nonparametric analyses is presented in selected exercises of Part 2 of this text. Other nursing textbooks, such as Gray and Grove (2021) , Kim et al. (2022) , Pett (2016) , and Terrell (2021) provide details about conducting and interpreting nonparametric analyses.

Interval and ratio levels of measurement
With interval level of measurement , the distances between intervals of the scale are numerically equal. However, there is no absolute zero, which means the score of zero does not indicate the property being measured is absent. Temperature is an example of a variable that is measured at the interval level, because the intervals between the different temperatures on either Fahrenheit or centigrade temperature scales are numerically equal. In addition, zero temperature is not the absence of temperature: it indicates very cold or freezing temperature.

Study participants’ scores obtained from multi-item scales are usually considered interval-level measurement. Likert scales are an example of multi-item scales commonly used to collect data about abstract concepts such as anxiety, perception of pain, quality of life, and depression. Each item on the scale has a response set for participants to mark, which might include 1—strongly disagree to 4—strongly agree. The number and type of response options vary based on the scale. The values obtained from each item in the scale are summed to obtain a single score for each study participant. Although the values of each item are technically ordinal-level data, the summed score is often analyzed as interval-level data ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale is an example of a 20-item, 4-point Likert scale that is used to measure depression in nursing studies ( Radloff, 1977 ), and the data from this scale are considered interval level for analysis.

Ratio level of measurement is the highest form of measurement; it adheres to the same rules as interval-level measurement, with numerically equal intervals on the scale (see Fig. 1.1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). In addition, ratio-level measurement has an absolute zero point, where at zero the property is absent, such as zero weight meaning absence of weight. In nursing, many physiologic variables are measured at the ratio level, such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, body mass index (BMI), and laboratory values ( Stone & Frazier, 2017 ). Variables measured at the interval and ratio levels are also referred to as continuous variables (see Table 1.1 ). The data, if normally distributed, obtained from measuring continuous variables are analyzed with parametric statistics ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

Parametric analysis techniques
Parametric statistics are powerful analysis techniques conducted on interval and ratio levels of data to describe variables, examine relationships among variables, and determine differences among groups ( Kim et al., 2022 ; Knapp, 2017 ). The assumptions of parametric statistics are introduced here and discussed in more detail for the parametric analysis techniques conducted in Part 2 of this text. If study data do not meet the assumptions outlined as follows, then researchers conduct nonparametric analyses to address the study questions and hypotheses ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Pett, 2016 ).

Assumptions for parametric analyses:

1.
The distribution of scores in a sample is expected to be normal or approximately normal.

2.
The variables are continuous, measured at the interval or ratio level.

3.
The data can be treated as though obtained from a random sample.

4.
All observations within each sample are independent ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

Parametric analysis techniques are the same for variables measured at either the interval or the ratio level of measurement. For example, means and standard deviations can be calculated to describe study variables measured at the interval or the ratio level (see Exercises 8 and 9 ). Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson r ; see Exercise 13 ) is computed to determine relationships between variables, and the t -test (see Exercises 16 and 17 ) or analysis of variance (ANOVA; see Exercise 18 ) are calculated to determine significant differences among groups. Significant results are those in keeping with the outcomes predicted by the researcher, where the null hypothesis is rejected . Significant results are usually identified by * or p values less than or equal to alpha (α), which is often set at 0.05 in nursing research ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Heavey, 2019 ). The symbol ≤ 0.05 means less than or equal to 0.05, so any p values ≤ 0.05 are considered significant. Because the analysis techniques are similar for variables measured at the interval and ratio levels, these levels of measurement are sometimes referred to as interval/ratio level. In addition, these variables are identified as continuous in this text (see Table 1.1 ).

Introduction
Ha and colleagues (2018, p. 54) conducted a descriptive correlational study to examine “the association between a single 6-min walk test (6MWT) and exercise confidence in HF [heart failure] patients.” The sample included HF patients from an outpatient clinic, who completed the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and an Exercise Confidence Scale before and after the 6MWT. The CDS was a 26-item Likert scale developed to measure depressive symptoms in cardiac patients. The scale included response sets that ranged from “1 = Not at all tearful” to “7 = Very easily tearful,” with higher numbers indicating increased severity of symptoms. The Exercise Confidence Scale is a self-reported measure of confidence of cardiac patients to perform a range of physical activities on a scale of 0 to 100 (where 0 = “Quite uncertain,” 50 = “Moderately certain,” and 100 = “Completely certain”). The Exercise Confidence Scale is a multi-item rating scale, and the values obtained from this scale are analyzed as interval-level data ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

“The 6MWT was associated with a significant improvement in exercise confidence in HF patients. Exercise confidence is associated with age, gender, duration of HF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and severity of depressive symptoms” ( Ha et al., 2018 , p. 59). The researchers recommended further controlled studies to determine whether the 6MWT and exercise confidence translate into improved exercise adherence and physical functioning in HF patients.

Relevant study results
“There were 106 participants, most of whom were male (82%) with a mean age of 64 ± 12 years ( Table 1.2 ). Almost three-quarters (72%) had a history of reduced EF [ejection fraction] (<40%) and one-quarter (25%) had preserved EF (≥40%).... Approximately one-third of patients (36/106; 34%) were depressed (CDS ≥ 95) and the prevalence of depression increased with greater NYHA class (NYHA class I, 11%; NYHA class II, 44%; NYHA class III, 64%).... There were no significant differences detected in any clinical characteristics between patients with HFrEF [heart failure with reduced ejection fraction] or HFpEF [heart failure with preserved ejection fraction].

One hundred two patients (96%) had complete data for Baseline Exercise Confidence. Participant mean scores indicated higher Baseline Exercise Confidence for Walking (70 ± 25), Climbing (75 ± 30), and Lifting Objects of Graded Weight (71 ± 29) than for Running (35 ± 30). Total Exercise Confidence exceeded the midpoint of the Exercise Confidence Scale, indicating greater than ‘moderate certainty’ to complete exercise activities overall (62 ± 24). Total Exercise Confidence and all subscales were inversely associated with age, NYHA class, CDS score, and 6MWD.... Additionally, duration of HF was inversely associated with Climbing and Lifting Confidence, while BMI [body mass index] was inversely associated with Walking Confidence. Male participants had significantly higher scores compared with females for the Total Exercise Confidence” ( Ha et al., 2018 , pp. 56–57).

Answers to study questions

1.
The sex or gender demographic variable was measured at the nominal level and included two categories, male and female, that cannot be rank ordered (see Fig. 1.1 ). BMI was measured at the ratio level because it is a continuous physiologic variable with an absolute zero (see Fig. 1.1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Stone & Frazier, 2017 ).

2.
The type of HF demographic variable was measured at the nominal level. The HF categories included in this study (HFrEF, HFpEF, and not documented) were exclusive (each cardiac patient fit into only one category) and exhaustive (all cardiac patients fit into one category). The types of HF cannot be ranked, because one category is not clearly higher or lower than another category, resulting in a nominal level of measurement rather than an ordinal one (see Fig. 1.1 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

3.
No data were missing for the types of HF variable. The frequencies and percentages for the types of HF categories were as follows: HFrEF was n = 76 (72%), HFpEF was n = 27 (25%), and not documented was n = 3 (3%). The two common types of HF (HFrEF and HFpEF) included most of the study participants ( n = 103, 97%) and the other HF patients ( n = 3, 3%) fit into the open category of not documented. No data were missing for this demographic variable, because the frequencies in the categories added to the sample size N = 106, 100% ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

4.
The mode for the comorbidities variable for this sample of cardiac patients was hypertension, n = 71 (67%). These results indicate that many of the patients with HF have hypertension and should be closely monitored and managed for this comorbidity.

5.
The level of measurement for the participants’ age was ratio, because age has an underlying continuum of years in this study. Each year includes the same equal intervals of 12 months or 365 days. Age has an absolute zero, because zero indicates the absence of age for a person. Age might also be called a continuous variable because it has a continuum of values (see Table 1.1 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

6.
In this hypothetical study, the income variable is measured at the ordinal level. The income categories are exhaustive, ranging from less than $70,000 to greater than $130,000. The two open-ended categories ensure that all salary levels are covered. The categories are not exclusive, because categories (d) and (e) both include a $130,000 salary, so study participants making $130,000 might mark either (d) or (e) or both categories, resulting in erroneous data. Category (e) could be changed to > $130,000, making the categories exclusive. The categories can be rank ordered from the lowest salary to the highest salary without a continuum of values, which is consistent with ordinal data ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

7.
The sample was composed of 82% males (see the study narrative) and the frequency of males in the study was n = 87 (106 [sample size]– 19 [number of females]). The sample was predominately males, making the results representative of the male gender. The study included only 19 females (18% of the sample), which limits the representativeness of the study results for females with HF.

8.
Nonparametric statistics—frequencies and percentages—were conducted to analyze the nominal-level data in Table 1.2 . Nominal data are sorted into categories that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, and only nonparametric analysis techniques can be conducted on this level of data ( Kim et al., 2022 ; Pett, 2016 ). Parametric analyses are conducted on variables measured at the interval or ratio level ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

9.
Exercise confidence of the patients with HF was measured with the Exercise Confidence Scale that included four subscales focused on Walking, Climbing, Lifting Objects of Graded Weight, and Running (see the study narrative). This was a rating scale with values ranging from 0 to 100. The patients’ scores for the Total Exercise Confidence Scale and the subscales were considered interval-level data and analyzed with parametric statistics, such as means and SDs (see the study narrative; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

10.
The highest risk factor or comorbid condition was hypertension (HTN) in both studies. Ha et al. (2018) reported 67% of the study participants had HTN compared with 90% in the Jafri et al. (2022) study. HTN is a common risk factor for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); therefore HTN needs to be monitored and managed appropriately in patients with CVDs.

Statistical technique in review
Sampling or eligibility criteria include a list of requirements or characteristics essential for membership in the target population. Sampling criteria include both inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion sampling criteria are the requirements identified by the researcher that must be present for an element or participant to be included in a sample. Sampling exclusion criteria are the requirements identified by the researcher that eliminate or exclude participants from being in a sample. Researchers may identify from very broad sampling criteria to very specific criteria. Broad sampling criteria can promote a large, diverse, or heterogeneous population, although specific sampling criteria promote a smaller, more homogeneous population ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

A population is the particular group of elements or individuals who are being studied, such as central catheters, adults with diabetes, or overweight children. The sampling criteria determine the target population , and the sample is selected from the accessible population or the available potential study participants within the target population. The sample is the focus of a particular study. Fig. 2.1 demonstrates the relationships among the concepts of population, target population, accessible population, sample, and study elements ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The study elements are the participants, objects, or events that might be included in the sample for a study. When the study is completed, researchers determine the extent to which the findings can be generalized or transferred from the sample to the accessible population. If the findings from a study are significant and consistent with the findings from previous studies, the findings might be generalized to the target population ( Kazdin, 2022 ).

A diagram of nested circles illustrates population sampling from population to study element. The diagram shows a set of four concentric circles labeled to represent different levels of population sampling. The outermost circle of the fourth circle is labeled target population with a note in parentheses that reads determined by sampling criteria. The third circle is labeled accessible population with a note in parentheses that reads available to researchers. The second circle is labeled sample with a note in parentheses that reads selected with sampling method. At the center is a small circle labeled study element with a note in parentheses that reads participant, subject, object, or event. Arrows point from each label to its corresponding circle.

LINKING POPULATION, SAMPLE, AND ELEMENT IN A STUDY.

The sample size is the number of individuals or elements that participate in a study. An adequate sample size is essential for identifying significant relationships among variables or differences between groups. Power is the probability that a given statistic can detect relationships or differences that exist in the population studied ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Put another way, statistical power refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false. “Statistical power is indexed on a scale of 0.00 to 1.00, with zero indicating there is no chance of rejecting a false null hypothesis and 1.00 indicating the false null hypothesis will be rejected 100% of the time it is studied” ( Taylor & Spurlock, 2018 , p. 263). Large samples increase the power of the statistics conducted so that researchers might accurately accept or reject the null hypotheses for their study. Power analysis is a statistical technique conducted to determine the sample size needed to detect significant relationships and differences between groups in a study. A power analysis includes the following four elements: (1) alpha or level of significance set by the researcher, usually at 0.05; (2) standard power for a study is usually 0.80 or 80%; (3) effect size (strength of relationships among variables or extent of group differences); and (4) sample size ( Aberson, 2019 ; Cohen, 1988 ). A study effect size should be based on the results of similar studies or determined by conducting a pilot study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The process for conducting and interpreting power analyses is presented in Exercises 24 and 25 of this text.

Researchers need to identify a large enough accessible population to ensure an adequate sample is obtained after accounting for refusal and attrition rates. Refusal rate is the percentage of potential participants who decline to be in a study. The refusal rate is calculated using the following formula:

Refusal rate = (Number refusing to participate ÷ Number of individuals approached) × 100%
Example: Refusal rate = (5 decline to participate ÷ 50 approached) × 100% = 0.1 × 100% = 10%
Attrition rate is the percentage of participants who drop out of a study after the sample size has been determined based on the sampling criteria. Attrition can occur actively, when participants choose to drop out of a study for a variety of reasons, or passively, when participants are lost to follow-up. The attrition rate is calculated by dividing the number of participants who dropped out of the study by the total number of individuals in the study sample. Because study attrition happens for a variety of reasons, researchers must anticipate this rate and increase the number of participants recruited into a study to ensure an adequate sample size ( Grove & Gray, 2021 ).

Attrition rate = (Number dropping out of a study ÷ Total sample size) × 100%
Example: Attrition rate = (4 dropped out of study ÷ 80 sample size) × 100% = 0.05 × 100% = 5%
The refusal and attrition rates decrease the sample’s representativeness of the target population. Therefore refusal and attrition rates greater than 10% to 15% are of concern, and researchers should report the reasons people provided for declining to take part in or for dropping out of a study. Researchers need to take these rates into consideration when determining the findings for their study. Sample attrition also reduces the final sample size and decreases the power of the statistical analyses conducted to detect significant relationships among variables and differences between groups ( Aberson, 2019 ). Attrition from intervention and control groups in a study should be low and the group sizes approximately equal to maintain statistical power ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

Introduction
Ayar and Sabancioğullari (2022) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a repeated measures design. The experimental group received the Solution-Oriented Therapy Programme (SOTP) intervention and the control group received routine nursing care. The depression levels of the participants were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and perceived social support was measured with the Perceived Social Support Inventory (PSSI). The participants’ depression and social support were measured three times: before the intervention, after the intervention, and 3 months later. These researchers found that the participants in the experimental or intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in their BDI and PSSI scores compared with the control group. The sampling process from this RCT is presented as an example in the following study excerpt and is diagrammed in Fig. 2.2 .

A flow chart outlines the sampling, randomization, and follow up of experimental and control groups in a clinical study. The flow chart illustrates the process of participant selection and group assignment in a clinical study. It begins with patient sampling, listing 67 participants. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria number 61. These participants undergo randomization into two groups. The experimental group contains 31 participants, and the control group contains 30 participants. Both groups are assessed before the program using scales on acceptance information such as B D I and P S Q I. The experimental group receives the S O T P intervention, while the control group receives routine nursing care. After the program, both groups are evaluated again using B D I and P S Q I. One participant from the experimental group is discharged and not followed further. At the 3 month follow up, 29 participants remain in the experimental group after two patients drop out due to unrelated reasons. The control group has 29 participants remaining after one patient withdraws due to being lost to follow up. The chart includes directional arrows and explanatory labels at each stage.

Relevant study results
“Research population and sample
The present research was executed in the inpatient units of a public hospital, which is located in the city center. Within the scope of the study, the quantity of samples was determined as 57 with G*POWER, 0.7 effect size, 0.80 power, and a 0.05 error margin. The depressive patients were allocated to the study as experimental ( n = 28) or control ( n = 29) groups by utilizing simple random sampling.

Inclusion criteria
Depressive patients who were undergoing inpatient treatment, who were diagnosed with depressive disorder, who had recurrent depressive disorder at least 6 months ago, who were between the ages of 18 and 60, who were taking inpatient treatment in the psychiatry clinics, who had a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score between 30 and 45, and who knew how to read and write were included in the study.

Exclusion criteria
Depressive patients who had comorbid psychiatric disorders, who had psychotic symptoms, who had chronic organic illnesses, who had alcohol and/or substance abuse or addiction, and who took part in any support group or psychotherapy were excluded from the present research” ( Ayar & Sabancioğullari, 2022 , p. 63).

“Research procedure
...The SOTP is a consultative approach developed to help depressive patients concentrate on their resources and strengths. The researcher has received theoretical/practical training and supervision about solution-oriented therapy with a certification, so she designed the SOTP for the current study.... The depressive patients in the control group were provided with routine clinical care.... The patients in the experimental group were asked not to share information about the interventions applied in the program, the recommendations given, and homework with other patients. In addition, the patients in the experimental and control groups were called at different times for measurements and interviews, and interviews were held in different places ( Fig. 2.2 ).

Ethics
Each stage of the study was executed in line with the ethical principles. Before the application of treatment, permission/approval was obtained from the University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee.... Moreover, verbal and written informed consent forms were collected from the participants of the study. The depressive patients were unaware of which research group they were allocated” ( Ayar & Sabancioğullari, 2022 , pp. 63–65).

Answers to study questions

1.
This study was an RCT with a repeated measures design. The independent variable or intervention was the SOTP. The dependent or outcome variables were depression level and perceived social support.

2.
The population studied included patients with depression and the setting was inpatient units of an urban, public hospital. The population and setting were appropriate to address the study purpose that was focused on the effect of SOTP intervention on the depression levels and perceived social support of hospitalized patients with depression.

3. Yes, the sample exclusion criteria were clearly identified with a header as “Depressive patients who had comorbid psychiatric disorders, who had psychotic symptoms, who had chronic organic illnesses, who had alcohol and/or substance abuse or addiction, and who took part in any support group or psychotherapy” ( Ayar & Sabancioğullari, 2022 , p. 63). These are relevant exclusion criteria that reduce the effects of extraneous variables to increase the validity of the design and the accuracy of the study findings. RCT is conducted with a strong design and relevant sampling criteria to determine the effectiveness of the intervention being tested ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

4.
This study included an experimental group that received the SOTP intervention and a control group that received routine care (see Fig. 2.2 ). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups, resulting in independent groups ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

5.
Initially the experimental group included 31 participants and the control group included 30 participants. Three months after the SOTP was implemented, the experimental group included 28 participants. The attrition number is 3 and the attrition rate = (3 ÷ 31) × 100% = 0.097 × 100% = 9.7%. The attrition rate for the experimental group is not a weakness because it is small (less than 10%) and will probably have limited effects on the study results ( Aberson, 2019 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

6.
Refusal rate = (number of participants declining to participate in a study ÷ by the number of potential participants approached) × 100%. The number declining to participate = 250 − 235 = 15. Refusal rate = (15 refused to participate ÷ 250 potential participants approached) × 100% = 0.06 × 100% = 6% ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

7.
Graphics, such as Fig. 2.2 , provide quality reporting of the sampling process in RCTs and other quasi-experimental and experimental studies. This type of figure can be used to identify the number of potential participants, indicate those meeting sample criteria, refusal numbers and rates, numbers in each group, attrition numbers and rates, and final size of study groups. A sampling algorithm, such as Fig. 2.2 , is considered the standard for reporting RCTs by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Statement ( Page et al., 2021 ).

8.
Power is the probability that a given statistic can detect differences or relationships that exist in the population studied. Put another way, statistical power refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false ( Taylor & Spurlock, 2018 ). With adequately powered statistical analyses, researchers can more accurately accept or reject the null hypotheses in their study. The minimum acceptable power is usually set at 0.80 or 80% for power analysis and the level of significance or alpha (α) is typically set at 0.05 ( Aberson, 2019 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

9.
Yes, the researchers executed the study according to ethical principles and obtained the approval to conduct the study from the University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Verbal and written informed consent forms were obtained from each of the study participants.

10.
You might have listed any of the following design strategies. RCT is considered a gold standard for examining differences between intervention and control groups in studies. The sampling criteria were very specific, which increased the similarities of the study participants and reduced the potential for error in determining group differences. A power analysis was conducted to determine an adequate sample size for this study. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups, decreasing the potential for bias. The patients in the experimental group were asked to not share information with those in the control group and the outcome variables were measured at different times. The BDI and PSSI are considered quality methods for measuring the study outcomes ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).Identifying probability and nonprobability sampling methods in studies EPUB version of this book

Statistical technique in review
A sampling method is the process of selecting people, events, behaviors, or other elements that are representative of the population being studied ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). The sampling methods implemented in research are usually categorized as either probability (random) or nonprobability (nonrandom). Tables 3.1 and 3.2 identify the common probability and nonprobability sampling methods applied in quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and outcomes studies in nursing ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Heavey, 2019 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). Quantitative research is an objective research methodology used to describe variables, examine relationships or associations among variables, and determine cause-and-effect interactions between independent and dependent variables ( Creswell & Creswell, 2023 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Shadish et al., 2002 ). Qualitative studies are scholarly, rigorous approaches used to describe life experiences, cultures, and social processes from the perspective of the persons involved ( Creswell & Báez, 2021 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ). Mixed methods studies include methodologies from both quantitative and qualitative research to better understand the area of study ( Creswell & Clark, 2018 ). Outcomes research is a rigorous scientific method used to investigate the end results of health care. The sampling method used in a study is based on the type of research, the study problem and purpose, study design, population studied, and the expertise and experiences of the researchers.

PROBABILITY SAMPLING METHODS, COMMON APPLICATIONS, AND SAMPLE REPRESENTATIVENESS IN NURSING RESEARCH

Sampling Method	Common Application(s)	Sample Representativeness
Simple random sampling	Quantitative and outcomes research	Provides strong representativeness of the target population that increases with sample size.
Stratified random sampling	Quantitative and outcomes research	Provides strong representativeness of the target population that increases with control of stratified variable(s).
Cluster sampling	Quantitative and outcomes research	Is less representative of the target population than simple random sampling and stratified random sampling, but representativeness increases with sample size.
Systematic sampling	Quantitative and outcomes research	Is less representative of the target population than simple random sampling and stratified random sampling, but representativeness increases with sample size.
Probability sampling methods
Probability sampling , also known as random sampling, requires that every member or element of the study population has an equal and independent opportunity to be chosen for inclusion in a study. Probability sampling involves identifying the sampling frame or each person or element in a study’s target population and then randomly selecting a sample from that population (see Fig. 2.1 in Exercise 2 ). Thus probability sampling allows every person of the study population to be represented without researcher bias and minimizes sampling error. The purpose of sampling in quantitative research is to obtain study participants who are as representative of the target population as possible. The sample’s representativeness of the study population is increased by probability sampling. A large sample with a low refusal rate and minimal attrition has strong representativeness of the sample ( Aberson, 2019 ; Cohen, 1988 ). Four probability sampling designs commonly used to select random samples in quantitative and outcomes studies include simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Table 3.1 identifies these probability sampling methods, their common applications in studies, and the sample’s representativeness of the study population.

Simple random sampling is achieved by random selection of members from the sampling frame. The random selection can be accomplished in many different ways, the most common being a computer program to randomly select the sample from the sampling frame. Another example would be to assign each potential participant a number and then randomly select numbers from a random numbers table to fulfill the required number needed for the sample. Random sampling helps to ensure the sample is representative of the study population and that the study has adequate power to detect a difference or identify relationships if they are present (see Exercise 24 ). This sampling method is strongly representative of the target population, and the representativeness increases with sample size ( Aberson, 2019 ).

Random sampling is not to be confused with random assignment of study participants to groups , which is a design strategy to promote more equivalent groups (i.e., intervention and control groups) at the beginning of a study and to reduce the potential for error ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Shadish et al., 2002 ). Researchers should clearly indicate the sampling method and the process for group assignment in their research report.

Stratified random sampling is used when the researcher knows some of the variables within a population that will affect the representativeness of the sample. Some examples of these variables include age, gender, race/ethnicity, medical diagnosis, and severity of illness. The study participants are selected randomly based on their classification into the selected stratum of a variable. The strata identified ensure that all levels of the variable(s) are represented in the sample. For example, age could be the variable, and, after stratification, the sample might include equal numbers of participants in the established strata of age ranges: 18 to 39, 40 to 59, 60 to 79, and 80 years of age or older. Stratified random sampling is a strong sampling method that is representative of the target population, and the representativeness increases with control of the stratified variable(s) ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazin, 2022 ).

Researchers use cluster sampling (also referred to as complex sampling) in two different situations: (1) when the time and travel necessary to use simple random sampling would be prohibitive; and (2) when the specific elements of a population are unknown, therefore making it impossible to develop a sampling frame. In either of these cases, a list of institutions or organizations associated with the elements of interest can often be obtained. To conduct cluster sampling, a list of all the states, cities, institutions, or organizations associated with the elements of the population is developed. The states, cities, institutions, or organizations are then randomly selected from the list to form the sample. However, the data collected from study participants from the same institution are likely to be correlated and thus not completely independent ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Therefore cluster sampling produces a sample that is not as representative of the study population as with simple random sampling and stratified random sampling (see Table 3.1 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

Systematic sampling requires an ordered list of the members of a population. Individuals are selected through a process that accepts every k th member on the list using a randomly selected starting point. k is calculated based on the size of population and the sample size desired. For example, if the population has 1000 potential participants and a sample size of 100 is desired, then k = 1000 ÷ 100 = 10, which means that every 10th person or unit on a list is invited to participate in the study. The initial starting point must be random for the sample to be considered a probability sample. Also, steps must be taken to ensure that the original list was not ordered in any way that could affect the study results. Probability sampling methods are more commonly used in quantitative and outcomes studies to increase the representativeness of a study sample.

Nonprobability sampling methods
Nonprobability sampling is a nonrandom sampling technique that does not extend equal opportunity for selection to all members of the study population. You should never assume a probability sampling method was used in a study; rather, the researchers must identify the sampling method as probability or nonprobability for their study. In addition, researchers should describe the process for accomplishing the sampling method in a study. In clinical research, nonprobability sampling methods are used much more frequently than probability sampling methods because of the limited availability of potential subjects ( Holmes, 2018 ). The common nonprobability sampling methods applied in nursing research include convenience, quota, purposive, network, and theoretical sampling (see Table 3.2 ). Convenience sampling is the most frequently used sampling method in quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and outcomes nursing studies ( Creswell & Clark, 2018 ; Creswell & Creswell, 2023 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

TABLE 3.2

NONPROBABILITY SAMPLING METHODS, COMMONLY APPLICATIONS, AND SAMPLE REPRESENTATIVENESS IN NURSING RESEARCH

Sampling Method	Common Application(s)	Representativeness, Insight, Understanding
Convenience sampling	Quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and outcomes research	There is questionable representativeness of the target population, which improves with increasing sample size for quantitative and outcomes research.
This method is used in qualitative and mixed methods research to identify participants who are likely to have experience with the research topic.
Quota sampling	Quantitative, mixed methods, and outcomes research; rarely qualitative research	Use of stratification for selected variables in quantitative and outcomes research makes the sample more representative than convenience sampling.
In mixed methods research, participants of different ages, ethnic groups, or severity of illness may be selected to increase the depth and richness of the study findings.
Purposeful or purposive sampling	Qualitative and mixed methods research; rarely quantitative research	Focus is on insight, description, and understanding of a phenomenon, situation, process, or cultural element with specially selected participants who can provide quality data to address the study purpose.
Network or snowball sampling	Qualitative and mixed methods research; rarely quantitative research	Focus is on insight, description, and understanding of a phenomenon, situation, process, or cultural element in a difficult-to-access population. Intent is to identify additional participants who contribute to the study focus.
Theoretical sampling	Qualitative research	Focus is on obtaining quality participants with different perspectives, of an adequate number for developing a relevant framework, model, or theory in a selected area of study.
Researchers obtain a convenience sample by enrolling study participants who meet sample criteria, are accessible, and are willing to participate in a study ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). Individuals are enrolled in a study until the target sample size is obtained. Convenience sampling does not allow for the opportunity to control for sampling errors or biases. To counter the inability to control for biases, researchers must carefully examine the population being studied and adjust the sampling criteria to appropriately address the identified biases. For example, researchers might include only individuals with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in their study of the effects of diet education on hemoglobin A1c values. This sampling criterion of newly diagnosed diabetic patient decreases the potential for errors or biases created by previous diabetic education and other management strategies that patients might have experienced in the past to control their type 2 diabetes.

Researchers use quota sampling to ensure adequate representation of types of individuals who are likely to be underrepresented, such as women, minorities, the elderly, or the poor. A convenience sampling method is used in conjunction with quota sampling to help ensure the inclusion of the identified participant type. Quota sampling can be used to mimic the known characteristics of the population or to ensure adequate numbers of participants in each stratum. This sampling strategy is like stratified random sampling and is more frequently applied in quantitative than in qualitative studies. Quota sampling is recognized as more representative of the target population than convenience sampling because of the decreased opportunity for sampling error or bias (see Table 3.2 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

Purposive, network, and theoretical sampling methods are more commonly used in qualitative and mixed methods research rather than in quantitative and outcomes studies. Purposive sampling occurs when the researcher consciously selects participants, elements, events, or incidents to include in a study. Those selected by the researchers are information-rich cases or those from whom a lot of information can be obtained (see Table 3.2 ; Creswell & Báez, 2021 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ). Researchers usually try to include typical and atypical cases in the sample. This type of sampling has been criticized because the researcher’s judgments in the selection of cases cannot be evaluated. However, this sampling method can be a good way to explore new areas of study.

Network or snowball sampling makes use of social networks and the fact that friends often have common characteristics. The researcher identifies a few study participants who meet the sampling criteria and then asks them to assist in recruiting others with similar characteristics. Network sampling is useful for gathering samples that are difficult to obtain, have not been previously identified for study, or can help the researcher explore a particular area of interest or focus. Sampling errors or biases are inherent in networking samples because the study participants are not independent of one another ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

Theoretical sampling is used in the research process to advance the development of a theory and is more commonly used in grounded theory studies. Data are gathered from individuals or groups who can provide relevant information for theory generation. For example, a researcher might interview family members and patients to develop a theory of surviving a near-death experience. The researcher continues to seek study participants and collects data until saturation of the theoretical concepts and relationships has occurred. Saturation of data occurs when collecting data from new study participants does not add new knowledge regarding the study purpose. Participant diversity in the sample is promoted to ensure that the developed theory is applicable to a range of behaviors and settings ( Charmaz, 2014 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ).

Answers to study questions

1.
Nonprobability; convenience sampling method. Bronas et al. (2022) did not identify the sampling method in their study, but it was consistent with convenience sampling (see Table 3.2 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). The study participants with CKD were recruited from the community and asked to participate in the study. With convenience sampling, participants are recruited because they meet sample criteria and are available, accessible, and willing to participate, as in a study. Often when the sampling method is not identified, convenience sampling was used in a study. The random assignment of participants to groups is part of the design and should not be confused with simple random sampling ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

2.
The groups were formed by random assignment of participants to either the intervention or control group. Random assignment to groups is a study strength that promotes equivalence of the groups and reduces the potential for bias and errors that might affect the study results. Random assignment of participants to groups is an effective strategy used in quasi-experimental and experimental studies to determine the effectiveness of an intervention ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

3.
Nonprobability; purposive or purposeful sampling method. Chatreewatanakul et al. (2022) conducted a qualitative study; often purposive sampling is used to identify participants with in-depth, rich knowledge of the research topic (see Table 3.2 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ).

4.
Nonprobability; quota sampling method. A total of 30 women who met sample criteria were asked to participate but only 16 consented. The women were randomized into groups with stratification by menopause status. The initial sample is one of convenience that was strengthened by stratification by menopause status, resulting in quota sampling ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

5.
Answers may vary, but the best response is that the sample has limited representativeness of the population of women at high risk for breast cancer. Nonprobability sampling decreases representativeness of the population; however, quota sampling is the strongest of nonprobability sampling methods for promoting representativeness (see Table 3.2 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The sample size for the pilot study was small at 16 because 14 (46.7%) of the women approached for the study refused to participate. The small sample size and high refusal rate reduce the representativeness of the sample ( Aberson, 2019 ).

6.
Nonprobability; purposive and theoretical sampling. Currin-McCulloch et al. (2022) clearly identified that their qualitative study included purposive and theoretical sampling to develop a framework for YA with advanced cancer ( Creswell & Poth, 2018 ). This sampling combination is often used with grounded theory studies. The initial participants were identified using a purposive sample to select individuals with rich, in-depth information related to the study topic. Theoretical sampling was used to identify participants who might provide details to expand the conceptual framework being developed.

7.
Probability; simple random sampling method. The sampling frame and method were identified by Hurley et al. (2018) . The sampling frame was all RNs in the Tennessee Board of Nursing 2015 database who were randomly selected for study participation. The researchers should have identified how the sample was randomly selected, but it was probably done by a computer program.

8.
Probability; systematic sampling method. Rekisso et al. (2022) clearly identified that systematic sampling was used to obtain their sample from five randomly selected public hospitals. The sampling interval was every sixth nurse from the population sampling frame. However, the researchers needed to provide more detail about the development of the sampling frame and if the initial starting point was random for this systematic sampling process ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

9.
Probability; cluster sampling method. McCarthy et al. (2018) identified their sampling approach as having two stages. The first stage involved the selection of nursing units, which is done with cluster sample to identify the settings for the study participants. The second stage involved randomly selecting nurses from these units. This multistage process of sampling is consistent with cluster sampling when the sampling frame of potential participants is not available. The researchers also identified how the nurses were randomly selected from the hospital units ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

10.
Probability; stratified random sampling. Lee et al. (2021) conducted a survey of RNs who were randomly selected from the sampling frame of the California BRN. However, the process for random selection of the RNs was not described but was probably achieved by computer program. The study included proportional stratified random sampling because the number of RNs included in each stratum is proportional to the RN population of each region ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

Study excerpt: Loew et al. (2018) conducted a mixed-methods study of college women to define responsible sexual behaviors. Phase I of the study was quantitative and Phase II was qualitative. “Participants in this study were all women who had, or might have, sex with men; that is, women not in exclusively same-sex partnerships. All participants were 18 to 35 years old, English-speaking, and attended a large, public, Midwestern university. More than 2000 women completed Phase 1 of the study, a survey; of these approximately 900 volunteered to participate in the Phase II interviews. Women were selected from this pool to be interviewed using a purposive maximum variation sampling strategy.... Based on survey data, women were sampled based on variation in their knowledge and use of emergency contraception and on some aspects of sexual history.... Theoretical sampling was used to select potential participants based on the data as they were collected, including women who had experienced a pregnancy termination or ‘false alarm’ pregnancy.... This process yielded a sample of 35 women who represented a wide range of experiences. When saturation was reached, recruitment and data collection ended” (Loew et al., 2018, p. 1151).

(2018) conducted a correlational study to examine the association between parental knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) and their intentions to have their daughters vaccinated. “This study used HINTS [Health Information National Trends Survey] 2006-2007 because it was the only dataset that assessed the outcome variable, intention to vaccinate for HPV.... HINTS’s probability-based sample design used a random-digit dialing to conduct telephone surveys and a nationwide address list to administer surveys via mail. A subsampling screening tool, Westat’s Telephone Research Center (TRC), was used to identify working residential numbers. A total of 3,767 telephone interviews were then completed, and 325 were partially completed ( n = 4,092); 3,473 mail surveys were completed and 109 were partially completed ( n = 3,582).

Individuals were excluded if they had: 1) history of a prior neurological event (e.g., stroke, head injury, encephalopathy); or 2) self-employment status. A sample size of 108 was calculated to achieve adequate (≥ 80%) power for the quantitative aims of this study. For the qualitative data collection, a purposive sample ( n = 40) from the total sample were recruited... to ensure that cases for the qualitative analysis emerged that provided the maximum heterogeneity on specific attributes (e.g., age, race, CVD diagnosis and occupation)” ( Dickson et al., 2021) , p. 448).

Statistical technique in review
The reliability of a measurement method or instrument denotes the consistency of the measures obtained of an attribute, concept, or situation in a study or clinical practice. Broadly, reliability is concerned with the dependability, consistency, stability, precision, and reproducibility of a measurement method ( Bartlett & Frost, 2008 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). An instrument that demonstrates strong reliability in the measurement of a variable or concept has less random error ( Bialocerkowski et al., 2010 ). For example, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was developed through research to diagnose depression in mental health patients ( Radloff, 1977 ). Over time, different versions of the CES-D have been developed; and these versions have proven to be quality measures of depression in clinical practice and in research for children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly ( Armenta et al., 2014 ; Cosco et al., 2017 ; Jiang et al., 2019 ; Siddaway et al., 2017 ). If a scale like the CES-D consistently measures a concept, then it is considered reliable. However, when a scale produces inconsistent scores with repeat testing of study participants or has low reliability values, it is considered unreliable, resulting in increased measurement error ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Reliability testing examines the amount of random error in an instrument that is used in a study. Because all measurement methods contain some error, reliability exists in degrees and usually is expressed as a correlation coefficient. Estimates of reliability are specific to the sample being tested . High reliability values reported for an established instrument do not guarantee that reliability will be satisfactory in another sample or with a different population. Researchers need to perform reliability testing on each instrument used in a study to ensure that it is reliable for that study sample ( Bialocerkowski et al., 2010 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). The three most common types of reliability testing reported in healthcare studies are stability reliability, equivalence reliability, and internal consistency or homogeneity. Table 4.1 summarizes these types of reliability testing ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

TABLE 4.1

DETERMINING THE RELIABILITY AND READABILITY OF MEASUREMENT METHODS

Quality Indicator	Description
Reliability	
Stability reliability: Focused on the reproducibility of scores with repeated measures of the same concept or attribute with an instrument or scale over time. Stability is usually examined with test-retest reliability.

Equivalence reliability: Includes interrater reliability and alternate forms reliability.

Interrater or interobserver reliability: Comparison of raters in determining their equivalence in rating variables or events in a study. Interobserver reliability is focused on the agreement between two or more observers in a study.

Alternate forms reliability: Correlation between different forms of the same instrument to determine their equivalence in measuring a concept.

Internal consistency: Degree of homogeneity or consistency of items within a multi-item scale. Each item on a scale is correlated with all other items to determine the consistency of an instrument in measuring a concept. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is the frequently conducted statistic reported for internal consistency of a multi-item scale.

Precision	
Precision of physiologic measure: Degree of consistency or reproducibility of the measurements made with physiologic instruments or equipment on the same variables under specified conditions. The smaller the change sensed in the instrument, the greater the precision in the measurement equipment.

Readability	
Readability level: Conducted to determine the participants’ ability to read and comprehend the items on an instrument. Researchers should report the level of education needed to read the instrument. Readability level must be appropriate to promote reliability and validity of an instrument.

Stability reliability
Stability reliability is concerned with the consistency of repeated measures of the same variable or attribute with the same scale or measurement method over time. Stability is commonly referred to as test-retest reliability because of the repeated measurement of a variable over time. Reliability testing examines the amount of random error in a measurement technique, and a quality measurement method should have acceptable reliability for a study sample ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). For example, if a scale is being used to measure stress in a study, the study participants given this scale should mark the items similarly if they are given the same stress scale at a later time (e.g., 1–2 days later). If the participants complete the scale in a similar way from one time to the next, this indicates adequate test-retest reliability, which is designated by an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values vary based on the test-retest reliability of the scale, the changes in the participants over time, and the changes in the administration of the scale. However, the higher the correlation coefficient obtained in a study, the stronger the test-retest reliability for the measurement method ( Kim et al., 2022 ). Koo and Li (2016, p. 161) recommend evaluating the ICC “level of reliability using the following general guideline: Values less than 0.50 are indicative of poor reliability, values between 0.50 and 0.75 indicate moderate reliability, values between 0.75 and 0.90 indicate good reliability, and values greater than 0.90 indicate excellent reliability.”

Equivalence reliability
Equivalence reliability includes interrater reliability and alternate forms reliability (see Table 4.1 ). Interrater reliability is the comparison of two raters or judges to determine their equivalence in rating variables or events in a study. Interobserver reliability is focused on the agreement between two or more observers in a study ( Bandalos, 2018 ). There is no absolute value less than which interrater reliability is unacceptable because the behaviors or situations being judged or observed vary in complexity and abstractness ( Bialocerkowski et al., 2010 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). However, any Pearson r value less than 0.70 should generate concern about the reliability of the data, data gatherer, or both. The interrater reliability value should be reported in the research report and ideally should be 0.80 (80%) to 0.90 (90%) or higher, which means the raters are approximately equivalent during the study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

The kappa statistic or (kappa coefficient) is the most commonly used statistic to determine interobserver agreement in a study ( Viera & Garrett, 2005 ). A kappa of 1 indicates perfect observer agreement that is never achieved because of measurement error, and a kappa of 0 indicates agreement equivalent to chance. Viera and Garrett (2005) recommended the following values be used when interpreting kappa: 0.01 to 0.20, slight agreement; 0.21 to 0.40, fair agreement; 0.41 to 0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61 to 0.80, substantial agreement; and 0.81 to 0.99, almost perfect agreement.

Comparison of two versions of a test or scale is referred to as alternate-forms reliability or parallel-forms reliability (see Table 4.1 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Alternative forms of tests are developed for normative knowledge testing such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), which is used as a college entrance requirement. There are many forms of this test, with a variety of items included on each. These alternate forms of the SAT were developed to measure students’ knowledge consistently and protect the integrity of the test. Multiple forms of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) have been developed and used for entrance to graduate school. For most scales, the development of two comparable versions of a scale is difficult and not often done ( Bannigan & Watson, 2009 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Internal consistency
Internal consistency , also known as homogeneity reliability testing, is used primarily with multi-item scales, where each item on a scale is correlated with all other items on the scale to determine consistency of measurement (see Table 4.1 ). The principle is that each item should be consistently measuring a concept, such as depression, and so should be correlated with the other items on the scale. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is the most commonly used measure of internal reliability for scales with multiple items. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients range from 0.00 to 1.00, where 1.00 indicates perfect reliability and a coefficient of 0.00 indicates no reliability or chance ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

A Cronbach’s alpha coefficient ≥ 0.80 indicates a strong reliability for a scale that has been used in a variety of studies. The stronger correlation coefficients, which are closer to 1.00, indicate less random error and a more reliable scale. For example, the CES-D has strong internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.84 to 0.90 in field studies ( Armenta et al., 2014 ; Cosco et al., 2017 ; Jiang et al., 2019 ). For relatively new scales, a reliability of 0.70 is considered acceptable because the scale is being refined and used with a variety of samples. Reliability coefficients of <0.60 indicate limited instrument reliability or consistency in the measurement of a variable or concept with higher potential for error ( Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Cronbach’s alpha coefficient can be used to calculate the error for a scale with a specific population. The alpha coefficient is squared and subtracted from 1.00 to determine the potential for error in the scores from a scale. The formula and example are presented as follows:

1.00 − (Cronbach’s alpha) 2 = measurement error 100% × error = Percentage of error
1.00 − (0.80) 2 = 1.00 − 0.64 = 0.36 100% × 0.36 = 36%
Many scales have subscales that comprise the concept measured, and the reliability of the subscales should also be included in a research report. The subscales of instruments usually have lower reliability coefficients (0.60–0.70) than the total scale. The number of items in the total scale provides a more stable measurement of a concept in a study than the subscales, with fewer items ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). If the data are dichotomous (yes or no responses) the Kuder-Richardson formula 20 (K-R 20) is used to estimate internal consistency ( Waltz et al., 2017 ). A research report should include the results from stability, equivalence, and homogeneity reliability testing done on a measurement method from previous research and for the present study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Precision
Precision is the degree of consistency or reproducibility of measurements made with physiologic equipment or devices. There should be close agreement in the replicated physiologic measures of the same variable or element under specified conditions ( Ryan-Wenger, 2017 ; Stone & Frazier, 2017 ). The precision of most physiologic equipment is determined by the manufacturer and is a part of the quality-control testing done by the agency using the device. To promote precision in physiologic measures or devices, researchers develop protocols to ensure consistent collection of physiologic data, transfer of specimens, and analysis of physiologic data or specimens. The physiologic equipment used to collect and analyze physiologic data should be recalibrated and maintained as indicated by the manufacturer.

Test-retest reliability is appropriate for physiologic variables that have minimal fluctuations, such as lipid levels, bone mineral density, or weight of adults ( Ryan-Wenger, 2017 ). Test-retest reliability can be inappropriate if the variables’ values frequently fluctuate with various activities, such as with pulse, respirations, and blood pressure (BP). However, test-retest is a good measure of precision if the measurements are taken in rapid succession. For example, the national BP guidelines encourage taking three BP readings 1 to 2 minutes apart and then averaging them to obtain the most precise and accurate measure of BP ( Todkar et al., 2021 ). Higher levels of precision (0.90–0.99) are important for physiologic measures that are used to monitor critical physiologic functions, such as arterial pressure and oxygen saturation ( Stone & Frazier, 2017 ).

Readability
Readability level is an essential element of the reliability and validity of an instrument. Assessing the grade level for reading an instrument is simple and takes seconds with the use of a readability formula, of which there are more than 30. These formulas count language elements in the document and use this information to estimate the degree of difficulty a reader may have in comprehending the text. The formulas provide an overview of the readability of a document based on estimated grade level, ease of reading, and grammar in the document. Readability formulas are now a standard part of word-processing software. When researchers determine the readability level of their measurement methods are appropriate for a study population, this strengthens the reliability and validity of the instruments in the study. Often a scale needs to be at the sixth-grade level for certain adults to be able to comprehend and complete it ( Waltz et al., 2017 ). Study participants must be able to read and understand the items on a scale in order to complete the items consistently and accurately.

The concepts of reliability and validity (see Exercise 5 ) should be evaluated together to determine the quality of a measurement method. An instrument that has low reliability cannot be valid because it is inconsistent in its measurement of the study variable or concept. However, an instrument can be reliable but not necessarily valid. For example, a Likert scale that was developed to measure pain has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84, but it is actually more focused on measuring stress and anxiety than pain, resulting in low validity for the scale. The measurement of study variables with reliable and valid measurement methods is essential for obtaining quality study results and findings. The questions in this exercise will help you critically appraise the reliability of scales and the precision of physiologic measures in published studies ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Some of the sources in this exercise are older because frequently used quality instruments are developed over years.

Introduction
Williams et al. (2017) conducted a predictive correlational study to determine whether stressful life events, perceived stress, and bullying were predictive of depressive symptoms in ninth graders. In addition, cortisol values and diurnal rhythm were examined in these adolescents. “A non-probability, convenience sampling method was used; the resulting sample consisted of 143 9th graders recruited from two public suburban southeastern U.S. high schools” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25). Nurses may encounter adolescents with depressive symptoms in many settings, but school is an optimal site to screen for these symptoms. The measurement methods for depressive symptoms, bullying, and cortisol values are presented in the following study excerpt.

Relevant study results
“Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Survey (CESD-10).... The CESD-10 was chosen due to the applicability for adolescent populations and the length of the measure (10 questions). In a study of n = 156 adolescents, reliability of CESD-10 was found to be α = 0.85 ( Bradley et al., 2010 ). Reliability for the current study was α = 0.86....

Bullying was measured using the Personal Experiences Checklist (PECK), a 32-item Likert scale instrument that was previously used in adolescents ages 8 to 15 years ( Hunt et al., 2012 ). This self-report instrument is scored from 0 to 4: 0 (never), 1 (rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (most days), and 4 (every day). Bullying behaviors included the following number of items, internal consistency, and test-retest coefficients: verbal/relational bullying (11 items, α = 0.90, r = 0.75); physical bullying (9 items, α = 0.91, r = 0.61); cyberbullying (8 items, α = 0.90, r = 0.86); and cultural bullying (4 items, α = 0.78, r = 0.77). High scores indicate more bullying. Reliability for the overall scale was α = 0.94 in the current study....

Cortisol diurnal rhythm (cortisol change from morning to afternoon) was assessed by collecting salivary specimens during an elective course in the morning school hours (8 am–11 am) and again in the afternoon school hours (12 pm–3 pm). When collecting saliva, 9th graders were asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything except water for approximately 1 h before sample collection. Upon arrival to the testing room, the participants were instructed to rinse their mouth thoroughly with water 5 to 10 min before the sample was collected to minimize potential pH variability and bacterial contamination. Specimens were collected using a passive drool approach to collect saliva in a cryo vial using a saliva collection aid for a period of 3 min while under the principal investigator’s supervision” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25).

Answers to study questions

1.
The three most common types of reliability testing reported in nursing studies are (1) stability reliability, (2) equivalence reliability, and (3) internal consistency or homogeneity (see Table 4.1 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Reliability testing determines the consistency of an instrument in measuring a variable and the potential for measurement or random error. An instrument with strong reliability and limited potential for error provides consistent data about a concept or variable. If an instrument has limited reliability in a study, reviewers need to question the results and findings related to the instrument ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

2.
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is calculated to determine the homogeneity or internal consistency of multi-item scales with ordinal, interval, or ratio levels of data in a study. A Cronbach’s alpha value should be determined for every multi-item scale and its subscales used in a study, because the scales’ reliability should be examined for a particular study sample ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). The Kuder-Richardson formula 20 (K-R 20) is calculated to determine the internal consistency of instruments with data measured at the nominal level. Researchers also need to discuss the reliability of the scales used in their study based on previous research ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

3.
If Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is 0.52, then the scale has a 0.52 internal consistency reliability and a 0.7296 (72.96% or 73%) measurement error. The measurement error calculation follows: 1.00 − (0.52) 2 = 1.00 − 0.2704 = 0.7296. The measurement error rate is determined by multiplying the measurement error by 100%; thus 100% × 0.7296 = 72.96% rounded to 73% error. The measurement error rate was to be rounded to the nearest whole percent. This scale has a high potential for measurement error, which means that researchers should question the results obtained from the adolescents in this study using this pain perception scale. In addition, the reliability of this scale should be reported as a limitation in the study ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Further research is needed to identify a reliable scale to measure pain perception in adolescents ( Waltz et al., 2017 ).

4.
The CESD-10 is a 10-item Likert scale developed to measure depression in adolescents. Multi-item scales are tested for homogeneity or internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (see Table 4.1 ; Bialocerkowski et al., 2010 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Multi-item scales might be considered ordinal- or interval-level measurements based on the construction of the scale. Thus the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is the appropriate statistic to conduct to determine the internal consistency of the CESD-10 scale ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

5.
The CESD-10 had a reliability α = 0.86 for the Williams et al. (2017) study. A reliability value greater than 0.80 is strong and indicates the scale had evidence of adequate reliability in this study ( Armenta et al., 2014 ; Bialocerkowski et al., 2010 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

6.
The percentage of random error for the CESD-10 scale in the Williams et al. (2017) study was 26%. The calculations for measurement error are: 1.00 − (0.86) 2 = 1.00 − 0.7396 = 0.2604. The measurement error rate is calculated by 100% × 0.2604 = 26.04%, which is rounded to the closest whole percent of 26%.

7.
Yes, the PECK is a Likert scale that is appropriate to gather data on bullying from adolescents. Williams et al. (2017 , p. 25) reported, “Bullying was measured using the PECK, a 32-item Likert scale instrument that was previously used in adolescents ages 8 to 15 years ( Hunt et al., 2012 ).” The reliability for the PECK in this study was α = 0.94. Thus the PECK has a history of being used with adolescents, and the internal consistency reliability was very strong in this study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

8.
Stability reliability is concerned with the consistency of repeated measures of the same variable or concept with the same scale or measurement method over time. Stability is commonly referred to as test-retest reliability because of the repeated measurements of a variable over time (see Table 4.1 ). The test-retest coefficient for verbal/relational bullying was r = 0.75. This test-retest reliability value is a strength and indicates the repeated measurement of bullying over time with PECK results in a stable value. The strong test-retest value reduces the potential for measurement error using the PECK in this study ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

9.
Researchers reporting appropriate reading levels or readability scores for their measurement methods in a study enhance the reliability and validity of the instruments. Study participants must be able to read and understand the items on an instrument to complete it consistently and accurately ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The measurement section for the PECK scale would have been strengthened by Williams et al. (2017) reporting the readability level of the PECK scale to ensure the reading level was less than the ninth-grade level. Study participants have varying levels of reading capability, so documenting a sixth- to seventh-grade level of reading would have strengthened the reliability and validity of the PECK used in this study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

10.
This statement indicates how precision was achieved in the collection of the saliva specimens. Precision is the degree of consistency or reproducibility of measurements obtained with physiologic instruments. Williams et al. (2017) documented the protocol that was followed to ensure consistent collection of salivary specimens that were uncontaminated by food and drinks in this study ( Ryan-Wenger, 2017 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Types of validity examined for measurement methods
A measurement method has validity if it accurately reflects the concept it was developed to measure. In examining validity, we focus on the appropriateness, meaningfulness, and usefulness of the measurement method in capturing the aspects of a selected concept. Validity, like reliability, is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon; it is measured on a continuum. No instrument is completely valid, so researchers determine the degree of validity of an instrument rather than whether validity exists or not ( DeVon et al., 2007 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Many types of validity exist, but this text focuses on the types most commonly reported in nursing studies, which include content validity, construct validity, and criterion-related validity ( Bannigan & Watson, 2009 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Table 5.1 provides a brief overview of content, construct, and criterion-related validity that are discussed in more depth in the following pages.

TABLE 5.1

EXAMINING THE VALIDITY OF MEASUREMENT METHODS

Quality Indicator	Description
Validity	
Content validity: Examines the extent to which a measurement method includes all the major elements relevant to the construct being measured.

Face validity: Type of content validity that verifies an instrument looks like it is valid or gives the appearance of measuring the construct for which it was developed.

Construct validity: Focuses on determining whether an instrument measures the theoretical construct that it purports to measure, which involves examining the fit between the conceptual and operational definitions of a variable.

Convergent validity: Type of construct validity where two scales measuring the same concept are administered to a group at the same time and the study participants’ scores on the scales should be positively correlated. For example, individuals completing two scales to measure depression should have positively correlated scores.

Divergent validity: Type of construct validity where two scales that measure opposite concepts, such as hope and hopelessness, administered to participants at the same time should result in negatively correlated scores on the scales.

Validity from factor analysis: Type of construct validity that determines whether an instrument includes the elements of the concept being measured by conducting exploratory and/or confirmatory factor analysis. Factor analysis is conducted to determine whether the items in an instrument are related and cluster together to form factors that reflect the elements or subconcepts of the concept being measured.

Validity from contrasting (known) groups: Type of construct validity where an instrument or scale is given to two groups that are expected to have opposite or contrasting scores, where one group scores high on the scale and the other scores low.

Successive verification validity: Validity is achieved when an instrument is used in studies with a variety of study participants in various settings.

Criterion-related validity: Validity that is strengthened when a study participant’s score on an instrument can be used to infer his or her performance on another variable or criterion.

Predictive validity: The extent to which an individual’s score on a scale or instrument can be used to predict future performance or behavior on a criterion.

Concurrent validity: Focuses on the extent to which an individual’s score on an instrument or scale can be used to estimate his or her present or concurrent performance on another variable or criterion.

Accuracy	
Accuracy of physiologic measures: Addresses the extent to which the physiologic instrument or equipment measures what it is supposed to measure in a study; comparable to validity for multi-item scales.

Content validity
Content validity examines the extent to which a measurement method includes all the major elements relevant to the concept being measured. The evidence for content validity of an instrument or scale includes the following: (1) how well the items of the scale reflect the description of the concept in the literature, which is usually called face validity ; (2) the content experts’ evaluation of the relevance of items on the scale that might be reported as an index; and (3) the study participants’ responses to scale items ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Construct validity
Construct validity focuses on determining whether the instrument measures the theoretical construct that it purports to measure, which involves examining the fit between the conceptual and operational definitions of a variable (see Chapter 8 in Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Construct validity is developed using several methods such as (1) convergent validity, (2) divergent validity, (3) validity from factor analysis, (4) validity from contrasting groups, and (5) successive verification validity (see Table 5.1 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Convergent validity is examined by comparing two scales or instruments that measure the same concept or construct, such as comparing a new instrument with an existing instrument. The two instruments are administered to a sample at the same time, and the results are evaluated with correlational analyses. If the measures or scales have moderate positive correlational values (0.40–0.50) or strong (0.60 or greater) correlational values, the validity of each instrument is strengthened (see Chapter 16 in Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). For example, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) has shown positive correlations ranging from 0.40 to 0.80 with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( Sharp & Lipsky, 2002 ). Jiang et al. (2019) correlated the responses of 2068 university student responses on a 14-item CES-D with those on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and found a convergent validity value of 0.744. Thus the CES-D has documented convergent validity with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the BDI-II.

Divergent validity is examined when participants complete two scales, at the same time, that measure opposite concepts. For example, the scores from two different scales, one measuring hope and the other measuring hopelessness, could be correlated to identify divergent validity. If the scores from the two measurement strategies have a moderate to strong negative correlation (such as −0.40 to −0.80), the divergent validity of both scales is strengthened ( Waltz et al., 2017 ). Convergent validity of scales is examined more frequently than divergent validity ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

Validity from factor analysis is conducted to determine whether an instrument includes the elements of the concept being measured. To employ factor analysis, the instrument must be administered to a large, representative sample of participants at one time. Usually, the data are initially analyzed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine relationships among the various items of the instrument ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Scale items that are closely related are clustered into a factor. Determining and naming the factors identified through EFA require detailed work on the part of the researcher in interpreting the EFA results and in comparing them to the relevant literature. Researchers can validate the number of factors in the instrument by conducting confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) . The factors confirmed through CFA are the subconcepts or subscales of a scale that can be examined in a study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Cosco et al. (2017) conducted a CFA of the 20-item CES-D scale and found it to include four subconcepts: (1) depressed affect, (2) somatic/vegetative factors, (3) positive affect, and (4) interpersonal. This four-factor structure is consistent with the original work conducted by Radloff (1977) . If the factor analysis results identify the essential elements of the concept to be measured by an instrument, then the validity of the instrument is strengthened ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Validity from contrasting groups is tested by identifying groups that are expected or known to have contrasting scores on an instrument and then asking the groups to complete the instrument (see Table 5.1 ). If the two groups have contrasting scores on the instrument, then the validity of the instrument is strengthened. For example, researchers could compare the scores on the CES-D scale ( Radloff, 1977 ) for a group of patients diagnosed with depression and a group of individuals who do not have a depression diagnosis. If the groups have contrasting scores, then the depression scale is thought to measure the concept of depression, and the validity of the scale is strengthened ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Successive verification validity is achieved when an instrument is used in studies with a variety of study participants in various settings ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). The validity of instruments is determined over time, with some of the strongest instruments developed over 20 to 30 years ago, resulting in older sources for scales used in studies.

Criterion-related validity
Criterion-related validity is examined by using a study participant’s score on an instrument or scale to infer her or his performance on a criterion. Criterion validity is strengthened when the participants’ scores on a scale are successful in determining their behaviors on a variable or criterion. Criterion-related validity includes validity from the prediction of future events and prediction of concurrent events (see Table 5.1 ). Validity from the prediction of future events is achieved when the scores on an instrument can be used to predict future behaviors, attitudes, and events ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). For example, fall risk assessment scales have been developed to predict the fall potential of elderly patients. The positive relationship of the scale score with the incidence of falls in the elderly strengthens the validity of this scale to determine the risk for falling. Thus elderly with high fall risk assessment scores require additional interventions to prevent their falling.

Validity from prediction of concurrent events can be evaluated by examining the ability to predict the concurrent value of one instrument based on the value obtained on an instrument to measure another concept. For example, researchers might use the results from a self-esteem scale to predict the results on a coping scale. Thus, if study participants with high self-esteem scores had high coping scores, this would add to the validity of the self-esteem scale ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

In summary, there are a variety of ways to add to the validity of an instrument, and an instrument’s validity needs to be discussed in the measurement section of a study. The validity of an instrument should be provided from instrument development (i.e., psychometric) research and from studies using it. In addition, a study might focus on examining an instrument’s validity if limited information is available. Stating that a scale is valid is insufficient information for the reader to assess the validity of the scale ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). An instrument must be both valid and reliable to provide a quality measurement of a concept in a study ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Bannigan & Watson, 2009 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Accuracy of physiologic measures
The accuracy of physiologic and biochemical measures is similar to the validity of scales used in research. Accuracy involves determining the closeness of the agreement between the measured value and the true value of the physiologic variable being measured. New measurement devices are compared with existing standardized methods (i.e., gold standard) of measuring a biophysical property or concept ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Ryan-Wenger, 2017 ). For example, measures of oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter were correlated with arterial blood gas measures of oxygen saturation to determine the accuracy of the pulse oximeter. There should be a strong, positive correlation (≥0.95) between pulse oximeter and blood gas measures of oxygen saturation to support the accuracy of the pulse oximeter. Accuracy of physiologic measures depends on the quality of the measurement equipment or device, detail of the data collection plan, and expertise of the data collector ( Ryan-Wenger, 2017 ). Researchers need to report the accuracy of the physiologic and biochemical measures used in their studies ( Stone & Frazier, 2017 ).

Introduction
Williams and colleagues (2017) conducted a predictive correlational study to determine whether stressful life events, perceived stress, and bullying were predictive of depressive symptoms in 9th graders. In addition, cortisol values and cortisol diurnal rhythm were examined in these adolescents. “A non-probability, convenience sampling method was used; the resulting sample consisted of 143 9th graders recruited from two public suburban southeastern U.S. high schools” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25). Nurses may encounter adolescents with depressive symptoms in many settings, but school is an optimal site to screen for these symptoms.

The Williams et al.’s (2017) article was the focus of Exercise 4 and included content relevant to the reliability of the measurement methods in this study. This exercise includes relevant content focused on the validity of the measurement methods for depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and cortisol values that are presented in the following study excerpt.

Relevant study results
“Depressive symptoms were measured with The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Survey (CESD-10) that has been used to measure four factors related to depressive symptoms including: positive/negative affect, somatic symptoms, retarded activity, and interpersonal issues. CESD-10 scores range from 0 to 30 with scoring from 0 to 3: 0 (rarely), 1 (some of the time), 2 (occasionally or moderate amount), 3 (all the time) for each item. A score of 10 or greater indicates need for referral (clinically meaningful). The CESD-10 was chosen due to the applicability for adolescent populations and the length of the measure (10 questions).... Reliability for the current study was α = 0.86.

Stressful life events (SLE) and the impact of these events or Life Change Units (LCU) were measured with The Coddington (1972) Life Events Scale for Adolescents (CLES-A). The CLES-A, designed for adolescents aged 13–19 years, had validity and reliability determined with test-retest reliability (α = 0.84)... and interclass correlation ( r = 0.63).... Reliability for the current study was α = 0.76.

Cortisol diurnal rhythm (cortisol change from morning to afternoon) was assessed by collecting salivary specimens during an elective course in the morning school hours (8 am–11 am) and again in the afternoon school hours (12 pm–3 pm). When collecting saliva, 9th graders were asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything except water for approximately 1 h before sample collection. Upon arrival to the testing room, the participants were instructed to rinse their mouth thoroughly with water 5–10 min before the sample was collected to minimize potential pH variability and bacterial contamination. Specimens were collected using a passive drool approach to collect saliva in a cryo vial using a saliva collection aid for a period of 3 min while under the principal investigator’s supervision. Specimens were kept on ice during data collection and then frozen at −20 °C until shipped to Salimetrics, LLC on dry ice. Duplicate analysis of saliva was completed with an ELISA/EIA assay, calibration range of 0.012–3.00 μg/dL and a sensitivity of <0.003 μg/dL to determine the cortisol levels. The expected range of salivary cortisol for adolescents aged 12–18 years is 0.021–0.883 μg/dL for morning and 0.0–0.259 μg/dL for afternoon, and the correlation between saliva and serum cortisol is r (47) = 0.91, p <0.0001 ( Salimetrics LLC, 2013 )” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25).

Answers to study questions

1.
The validity of a measurement method is determined by how accurately it measures the abstract concept it was developed to measure. The three categories of measurement validity presented in this text are content validity, construct validity, and criterion-related validity (see Table 5.1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

2.
Content validity is examined during the initial development of a scale. Researchers identify a concept like resilience that they want to measure for individuals with chronic illnesses. A review of the literature is conducted to define and identify possible subconcepts of this concept. Using this content, researchers develop possible items for a scale to measure resilience. The scale items are reviewed by experts for completeness, conciseness, clarity, and readability and refined as needed. Face validity is a type of content validity ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

3.
Construct validity includes convergent validity, divergent validity, validity from factor analysis, validity from contrasting groups, and successive verification validity ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Convergent validity involves determining the relationship between two instruments that measure the same concept, such as two scales to measure depression. Divergent validity involves comparing the scores from two scales that measure opposite concepts, such as scales measuring resilience and hopelessness. The data for these two types of validity need to be collected from the same sample at approximately the same time ( Waltz et al., 2017 ).

4.
Criterion-related validity is examined when an instrument predicts the future event length of stay for hospitalized patients with HF. The predictive criterion validity of the scale is strengthened if it can be used to successfully predict a future event such as length of stay of patients with HF ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Identifying patients at risk for prolonged hospital stay will direct nurses in how to best manage their care.

5.
The CESD scale probably has stronger validity than the Hamilton Depression Scale because it was developed and refined over 45 years to measure depression ( Radloff, 1977 ). In addition, the CESD scale has been refined for use with different age groups, and the CESD-10 is considered “applicable for adolescent populations” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25). A depression scale for adults would probably not be as valid as the CESD-10 in measuring depression in adolescents ( Waltz et al., 2017 ). The CESD-10 also has stronger successive verification validity, with its use in a variety of studies with different populations in various settings ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

6.
The CLES-A was used to measure stressful life events in this study. Content validity was addressed by indicating that the CLES-A measured “Stressful life events (SLE) and the impact of these events or Life Change Units (LCU)” ( Williams et al., 2017 , p. 25). The CLES-A was designed for adolescents 13 to 19 years of age, which adds to the scale’s validity. In addition, the CLES-A has successive verification validity because it was used in previous studies.

7.
No, the validity information provided for the CLES-A was not adequate in this study. Only limited, vague information on content and successive verification validity was provided. The researchers indicated the scale had validity, but no specific information was provided, so the validity of the scale cannot be evaluated ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

8.
Answers will vary. You need to identify two groups that you think would have different or contrasting values on the CLES-A ( Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). For example, you might contrast the scores of the CLES-A for 9th graders in private school versus those in public school. Students who are home-schooled might be contrasted with those in formal school settings using the CLES-A. These groups might be expected to have different stressful life events.

9.
Yes, there is a link between reliability and validity for a scale in a study. A scale must be reliable or consistently measuring a concept in a study if it is to be valid. The CLES-A had an acceptable (0.76) but not strong (≥ 0.80) reliability in this study (see Exercise 4 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

10.
Williams et al. (2017, p. 27) made the following recommendations for clinical practice: “It is important for nurses to recognize that 9th graders may be vulnerable and to seek them out for inquiry. Nurses should also advocate for screening of depressive symptoms in settings where 9th graders are readily accessible to try and identify and to refer for post screening follow-up and treatment if necessary.” The 9th grade students also need to be monitored for bullying and supported in the school setting.Understanding frequencies and percentages EPUB version of this book

Statistics for Nursing Research, EXERCISE 6, 70-81

Statistical technique in review
Frequency is the number of times a score or value for a variable occurs in a set of data. Frequency distribution is a statistical procedure that involves listing all the possible values or scores for a variable in a study. Frequency distributions are used to organize and examine data for data entry errors and coding or computer programming errors ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). In addition, frequencies and percentages are used to describe demographic or attribute variables and the major variables measured in a study at the nominal or ordinal levels (see Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

Percentage can be defined as a portion or part of the whole or a named amount in every hundred measures. For example, a sample of 100 study participants might include 40 females and 60 males. In this example, the whole is the sample of 100 participants, and gender is described as including two parts, 40 females and 60 males. A percentage is calculated by dividing the smaller number, which would be a part of the whole, by the larger number, which represents the whole. The result of this calculation is then multiplied by 100%.

Formula for percentage

Percentage (%) = (part of the whole or sample ÷ the whole or entire sample) × 100%
For example, if 14 nurses out of a total of 62 are working on a given day, you can divide 14 by 62 and multiply by 100% to calculate the percentage of nurses working that day. Calculations: (14 ÷ 62) × 100% = 0.2258 × 100% = 22.58% = 22.6%. The answer also might be expressed as a whole percentage, which would be 23% in this example. You need to read the directions for answering questions to determine the number of decimal places to include in the final answer ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

A cumulative percentage distribution involves the summing of percentages from the top of a table to the bottom. Therefore the bottom category has a cumulative percentage of 100% ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Cumulative percentages can also be used to determine percentile ranks, especially when discussing standardized scores. For example, if 75% of a group scored equal to or lower than a particular examinee’s score, then that examinee’s rank is at the 75th percentile. When reported as a percentile rank, the percentage is often rounded to the nearest whole number. Percentile ranks can be used to analyze ordinal data that can be assigned to categories that can be ranked. Percentile ranks and cumulative percentages might also be used in any frequency distribution where study participants have only one value for a variable. For example, demographic characteristics are usually reported with the frequency ( f ) or number of participants and percentage (%) of participants for each level of a demographic variable. Income level is presented as an example for 200 individuals in a study in Table 6.1 .

$100,000–$120,000

40	20%	95%
5.
>$120,000

10	5%	100%
In data analysis, percentage distributions can be used to compare findings from different studies that have different sample sizes, and these distributions are usually arranged in tables in order either from greatest to least or least to greatest percentages ( Heavy, 2019 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

Introduction
Mensinger and colleagues (2022) conducted a study to describe the well-being of hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) in the United States working during the initial phase of the novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19). The study included a cross-sectional design with a sample of 467 RNs. A cross-sectional design involves simultaneous examination of groups of study participants in various stages in a process, such as nurses’ well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the intent of inferring trends over time ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Well-being was measured using the following tools: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for depressive symptoms, Impact of Events Scale-Revised for traumatic stress, and the Insomnia Severity Index” ( Mensinger et al., 2022 , Abstract). The demographic variables described in this study are compared with the National Workforce Survey data obtained from the CHAMPS Registry. The prevalence of psychological symptoms in this study are compared with meta-analyses of these symptoms globally ( Batra et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2021 ). The Mensinger et al. (2022) study results are presented in the following research excerpt.

Relevant study results
“The demographic characteristics of hospital-based RNs are described in Table 6.2 . The second column of this table shows comparisons of our sample to the National Workforce Survey data on variables available. The CHAMPS hospital-based RN sample identified mostly as female (92%) and white (91%); 69% were under the age of 45 years. Ninety-three percent served in direct patient care with 26% identifying their primary work as taking place on a COVID-19 designated unit and another 26% identifying their primary site as the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared to the characteristics of the meta-analyses, our sample [was] comprised of a greater proportion of females (70% vs. 92%). However, they were relatively similar in age; data were available to calculate a weighted mean of 34.7 years for the Li study. This compares with a mean ( SD ) of 38.1 (12.4) years for present study’s CHAMPS hospital RNs. Additionally, the samples of the meta-analyses were primarily from Asian countries and included other healthcare workers with nurses comprising approximately 45% of their participants.

To answer our second study aim, we present the global prevalence rates of the symptoms captured in two recently published meta-analyses ( Batra et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2021 ) in the lower portions of Table 6.3 .... [The] findings showed that compared to global rates reported in Batra et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2021) , respectively, our sample of U.S. hospital-based RNs experienced significantly more traumatic stress (54.6% vs. 11.4%; p < 0.001) and (54.6% vs. 21.5%;... p < 0.001). Rates of insomnia were also significantly higher in the CHAMPS hospital-based RN sample compared to the Batra et al. meta-analysis (27.8% vs. 32.4%;... p < 0.033); the Li et al. review did not report on insomnia. Depressive symptoms were significantly more common in CHAMPS hospital-based RNs (54.6% vs. 31.8%;... p <.001) compared to the Batra et al. global rates and the rates reported by Li et al. (54.6% vs. 21.7%;... p <.001). While rates of anxiety symptoms reported in CHAMPS hospital-based RNs (37.3%) did not differ from the 34.4% reported in the Batra et al. review..., they were significantly higher than the 22.1% reported in the Li et al. review” ( Mensinger et al., 2022 , Results section).

Answers to study questions

1.
Mensinger et al. (2022) reported their study included 429 female nurses, which was 91.9% of the sample ( N = 467) (see Table 6.2 ).

2.
The 2020 National Workforce Survey was 90.5% female, which was very similar to the Mensinger et al. (2022) study that was 91.9% female. Based on the similar percentages, the two groups of nurses are probably not significantly different. However, no results are provided in the Mensinger et al. (2022) study to indicate if these groups are significantly different for any of the demographic variables.

3.
The largest educational category for the Mensinger et al. (2022) study is bachelor’s degree ( n = 338, 72.4%). The National Workforce Survey group included 48.1% bachelor-prepared nurses and 28.1% nurses with an associate’s degree or diploma. The Mensinger et al. (2022) sample only included 7.7% associate- or diploma-prepared RNs. Thus the educational level of the nurses in this study is higher than the National Workforce Survey group.

4.
No, the majority of the RNs are not in supervisory roles, as indicated by n = 55, 11.8%. The majority of the RNs were providing direct patient care ( n = 436, 93.4%), as presented in Table 6.2 .

5.
The frequency and percentage of RNs working in both the COVID-designated units and the ICUs need to be calculated using the results in Table 6.2 .

117 RNs in COVID units + 117 RNs in ICUs = 234 RNs
234 RNs ÷ 467 sample size (100%) = 0.501 × 100% = 50.1% or 50%
6.
Cumulative frequency or number of nurses working in hospitals in the Mensinger et al. (2022) study = 240 + 175 + 52 = 467 or the size of the sample. This demographic variable has no missing data. Cumulative percentage = 51.4% + 37.5% + 11.1% = 100%.

7.
The percentage of RNs with missing depression data was calculated as follows: 51 ÷ 467 (100%) = 0.109 × 100% = 10.9% or 11%.

8.
Yes, the percentage of RNs with anxiety in the Mensinger et al. (2022) study was 37.3%, which was similar to the 34.4% anxiety reported by Batra et al. (2020) . Li et al. (2021) had a smaller incidence (22.1%) of anxiety reported (see Table 6.3 ).

9.
Mensinger et al. (2022) reported insomnia was experienced by 438 RNs or 32.4% of the sample. In their meta-analysis, Batra et al. (2020) reported 18,546 (27.8%) RNs experienced insomnia. Li et al. (2021) did not include the psychological symptom of insomnia, so NA is reported in Table 6.3 . Yes, Mensinger et al. (2022) reported “Rates of insomnia were also significantly higher in the CHAMPS hospital-based RNs (27.8% vs. 32.4%; p < 0.033).” Alpha in this study was set at 0.05; the p value is less than alpha, so the results are significantly different for insomnia in these two studies ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

10.
Yes, the psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and traumatic stress are common symptoms you would expect RNs to report during the COVID-19 pandemic. The meta-analysis by Batra et al. (2020) identified these same psychological symptoms as being common for RNs during the pandemic. Li et al. (2021) also identified the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress. The meta-analyses had extremely large samples, providing support for the psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress commonly experienced by nurses during the pandemic. An online article identified stress, insomnia, and distress as common psychological symptoms for RNs during the pandemic, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8701954/ .

Statistical technique in review
Tables and figures are commonly used to present findings from studies or to provide a way for researchers to become familiar with research data. Using figures, researchers are able to illustrate the results from descriptive and correlational data analyses, assist in identifying patterns in data, identify changes over time, and interpret exploratory findings ( American Psychological Association, 2020 ). A line graph is a figure that is developed by joining a series of plotted points with a line to illustrate how a variable changes over time or how one variable changes in relation to another ( Kim et al., 2022 ; Terrell, 2021 ). A line graph figure includes a horizontal scale, or x -axis, and a vertical scale, or y -axis. The x -axis is often used to document time, and the y -axis is used to document the mean scores or values for a variable ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Plichta & Kelvin, 2013 ). For example, researchers might include a line graph to illustrate a relationship between anxiety and pain values for a sample of postsurgical patients. Line graphs might also be used to identify changes in experimental and comparison groups values for a selected variable.

Fig. 7.1 presents a line graph that documents time in weeks on the x -axis and mean weight loss in pounds on the y -axis for an experimental group consuming a low-carbohydrate diet and a control group consuming a standard diet. This line graph illustrates the trend of a steady increase in the mean weight lost by the experimental or intervention group and minimal mean weight change by the control group. It is important to note that sometimes, the slope of a line (or the amount by which a line deviates from the horizontal axis) in a line graph does not represent significant effects. Alternatively, sometimes lines do not indicate large changes, but may represent significant effects in large samples ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al, 2022 ).

A graph compares weight loss over 4 weeks between experimental and control groups. The graph presents a comparison of weight loss in pounds over a 4 week period between experimental and control groups. The horizontal axis is labeled weeks and ranges from 1 to 4. The vertical axis is labeled weight loss in pounds and ranges from 0 to 10. The experimental group is represented by circular markers connected by a line, and the control group is represented by square markers connected by a line. The experimental group shows a steady increase in weight loss from 2 pounds in week 1 to 6 pounds in week 4. The control group fluctuates slightly around 1 pound or less throughout the 4 weeks. A key on the right identifies the symbols for experimental and control groups. The horizontal and vertical axes are also labeled as x axis and y axis respectively.

Introduction
Donnelly and colleagues (2022) conducted a study to examine the firearm violence against children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the types of firearm violence that occurred against children in the United States (U.S.). The historical firearm data were obtained from the Gun Violence Archive, which includes the details of the current trends and types of child-involved shootings. This is an independent organization for evidence-based firearm research and includes information from over 7500 sources. Only firearm incidents with children younger than 18 were included, excluding suicides from firearms. The primary outcome focused on the number of child-involved shooting incidents and the secondary outcomes focused on the number of fatal and nonfatal firearm incidents over time. Donnelly et al. (2022, p. 66) hypothesized an increase in “total, fatal, and nonfatal child-involved shootings during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Direct quotes from this study are included in the following section.

Relevant study results
“METHODS

... U.S. Census population reports were used to weigh the rates of firearm violence per 100,000 children. The number of children in the United States during each year was recorded and these numbers were used in calculations for 2016 to 2019. Summary data for 2020 were not yet available. Therefore, 2020 projected pediatric population data were used from a report released by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics.... A linear trendline was fit to 2016 to 2019 data to show projected versus actual 2020 firearm violence.

The Giffords Law Center Annual Gun Law Scorecard grades each state using a point system to evaluate their gun legislation based on specific laws and policies. The points are tabulated, and the states are ranked from 1, which is the state with the strongest gun laws, to 50, which is the state with the weakest gun laws. We compared the top 25 stronger gun law states to the bottom 25 weaker gun law states.

Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare median monthly trends and types of child-involved firearm violence incidents between 2018 and 2020, as well as between 2019 and 2020.... Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 ( Table 7.1 )” ( Donnelly et al., 2022 , p. 66).

“RESULTS

There was a total of 1,076 child-involved shootings in 2020, 811 in 2019 and 803 in 2018. The median total child-involved shooting incidents per 100,000 children per month increased from 2018 to 2020 (0.095 vs. 0.124, p = 0.003), as well as from 2019 to 2020 (0.097 vs. 0.124, p = 0.010). From 2018 to 2020, child killed by adult (0.020 vs. 0.034, p = 0.024) incidents increased. Consistent, increasing trends in child killed by adult (0.021 vs. 0.034, p = 0.049) were also found between 2019 and 2020.... Total child-involved shooting incidents, as well as both fatal and nonfatal child-involved shooting incidents per 100,000 per year (2016–2020), all exceeded the projected number of incidents extrapolated from the 2016 to 2019 data ( Fig. 7.2 ).... Compared with weaker gun law states, stronger gun law states were associated with decreased monthly total child-involved shooting incidents between 2018 and 2020 (... p < 0.001)” ( Donnelly et al., 2022 , p. 66).

A graph compares total, nonfatal, and fatal child-involved shooting incidents per 100000 from 2016 to 2020. The graph presents child involved shooting incidents per year per 100000 population from 2016 to 2020. The vertical axis is labeled child involved shooting incidents per year per 100000 and ranges from 0 to 1.6. The horizontal axis is labeled years and includes the years 2016 through 2020. Three lines represent different categories total incidents marked with an asterisk, nonfatal incidents marked with a circle, and fatal incidents marked with a triangle. The total incidents line increases overall from 1.0 in 2016 to 1.45 in 2020 with slight fluctuations. The nonfatal incidents line rises gradually from 0.6 in 2016 to 0.9 in 2020. The fatal incidents line remains relatively flat from 0.35 in 2016 to 0.45 in 2020. A key at the bottom identifies the three lines as total incidents, nonfatal incidents, and fatal incidents.

“DISCUSSION

... This study found an overall increasing rate of child-involved shootings for the year of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, children were more likely to be fatally injured by an adult with a firearm. In addition, the strength of gun laws was shown to be associated with decreased rates of pediatric firearm violence. Given that access to social support systems and community safety nets has been hindered by the pandemic, implementation of stronger gun laws across all states may help reduce the number of fatal and nonfatal child-involved shooting incidents” ( Donnelly et al., 2022 , p. 68).

Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, and mode EPUB version of this book
Susan K. Grove, PhD, RN, ANP-BC, GNP-BC; Daisha J. Cipher, PhD

Statistics for Nursing Research, EXERCISE 8, 92-103

Statistical technique in review
Mean, median, and mode are the three measures of central tendency used to describe study variables. These statistical techniques are calculated to determine the center of a distribution of data, and the central tendency that is calculated is determined by the level of measurement of the data (i.e., nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio; see Exercise 1 ). The mode is a category or value that occurs with the greatest frequency in a distribution of data. Thus the mode is always a score in a distribution of sample data. The mode is the only acceptable measure of central tendency for analyzing nominal-level data, which are not continuous and cannot be ranked (see Fig. 1.1 in Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Most distributions of values in a study are unimodal , or have one mode, and frequencies progressively decline as they move away from the mode. A symmetric curve , like the one in Fig. 8.1 , is unimodal, and the left side of the curve is a mirror image of the right side of the curve. The mode, median, and mean are essentially equal. If a distribution has two scores that occur more frequently than others (two modes), the distribution is called bimodal . A distribution with more than two modes is multimodal ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

A bell-shaped graph with a central line labeled mean, median, and mode. The bell-shaped graph represents a normal distribution. A vertical line runs through the center of the graph and is labeled mean, median, and mode, indicating that all three statistical measures are equal and occur at the peak of the distribution. There are no numerical values or axes labels present. The graph has no additional markings or annotations.
FIG. 8.1 ■
SYMMETRICAL CURVE

The median (MD) is a score that lies in the middle of a rank-ordered list of values of a distribution. If a distribution consists of an odd number of scores, the MD is the middle score that divides the rest of the distribution into two equal parts, with half of the values falling above the middle score and half of the values falling below this score. In a distribution with an even number of scores, the MD is half of the sum of the two middle scores of that distribution. If several scores in a distribution are of the same value, then the MD will be the value of the middle score.

The MD is the most precise measure of central tendency for ordinal-level data and for non-normally distributed or skewed interval- or ratio-level data. Curves that are not symmetric are referred to asymmetric or skewed . A curve may be positively skewed, which means that the largest portion of data is below the mean ( Fig. 8.2 ). For example, data on the length of enrollment in hospices are positively skewed . Most people die within the first few days or weeks of enrollment, whereas increasingly smaller numbers survive as time increases. A curve can also be negatively skewed, which means that the largest portion of data is above the mean (see Fig. 8.2 ). For example, data on the occurrence of chronic illness by age in a population are negatively skewed , with most chronic illnesses occurring in older age groups. In a skewed distribution , the mean, median, and mode are not equal. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, which is greater than the mode. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode (see Fig. 8.2 ). However, in some skewed distributions of data, the mode and median are equal ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

Two graphs compare positively and negatively skewed distributions with labeled mean, median, and mode. The two graphs show bell shaped graphs representing skewed distributions. The graph on the left is labeled positively skewed. It shows three vertical lines from left to right labeled mode, median, and mean, indicating that the mode is the highest point, followed by the median and the mean farther to the right. The graph on the right is labeled negatively skewed. It shows three vertical lines from left to right labeled mean, median, and mode, indicating that the mean is farthest to the left, followed by the median and then the mode at the highest point. Both graphs are symmetrical in structure but skewed in opposite directions and placed above a straight horizontal line.

th
score
In the first example, the sample includes an odd number of study participants ( N = 31), so the median is an actual score in the distribution (16th score). In the second example, the sample includes an equal number of participants ( N = 40), so the median is halfway between the 20th and the 21st scores in the sampling distribution ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Terrell, 2021 ). Thus the median is sometimes a score in a distribution of sample data and sometimes not.

The mean ( 
X
¯
) is the arithmetic average of all scores of a sample, that is, the sum of its individual scores divided by the total number of scores. The mean is the most accurate measure of central tendency for normally distributed data measured at the interval and ratio levels and is only appropriate for these levels of data ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The mean is sometimes but often not a score in a distribution of sample data. In a normal distribution as presented in Fig. 8.1 , the mean, median, and mode are essentially equal (see Exercise 27 for determining the normality of a distribution). The mean is sensitive to extreme values, such as outliers. An outlier is a value in a dataset that is unusually low or unusually high in context of the rest of the sample data. Outliers can result in skewed distributions of data and skewness interferes with the validity of many statistical analyses. Therefore statistical procedures have been developed to measure the skewness of the distribution of the sample being studied (see Exercise 27 ). If a study has outliers, the mean is most affected by these, so the median might be the measure of central tendency included in a research report ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

Introduction
Oshvandi and colleagues (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effect of a video-based educational program on satisfaction and comfort in patients undergoing a transradial coronary angiography (TCA). A total of 89 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. All the TCA procedures were performed by one cardiologist, and patients who needed an analgesic to reduce pain were excluded from the study to reduce the potential for error ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Satisfaction was measured with the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ; a four-point Likert scale), and comfort was measured with a visual analog scale (VAS). VAS is a 100-mm line that patients mark to indicate their experiences, such as comfort level, that results in ratio-level data. Oshvandi et al. (2021, p. 27) reported that “after the intervention, the mean scores of satisfaction and comfort in the intervention group were higher than in the control group ( p < 0.001). Video-based educational strategies should be integrated into the nursing interventions to improve patients’ health status.”

Relevant study results
“In this study, the video-based educational program was conducted at 24 hours before the TCA, and the content of the educational package was presented to the patients by a video projector. The content of the educational package included the following: introduction of the catheterization laboratory atmosphere, being familiar with the equipment in the catheterization laboratory and the healthcare professionals working there, understanding and being familiar with the angiography procedure (how it is implemented, contrast injection, vascular access, etc.) and the care before, during, and after angiography. The training lasted about 40 minutes. At the end of the education, patients received a pamphlet of educational content, and the researcher also answered their questions” ( Oshvandi et al., 2021 , p. 28).

“Results Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants
In this study, a total of 89 patients were selected and then divided into two groups: intervention ( n = 44) and control ( n = 45). Mean and standard deviation of age in the intervention and the control group were 56.34 ± 10.23 and 60.18 ± 9.08, respectively. In terms of age, the t -test showed no significant difference between the two groups. In terms of gender, most participants in the intervention (59.1%) and the control group (76.2%) were male. More than 85% of patients in both groups were married. Most patients in the intervention (75%) and the control group (64.4%) were not smokers. The two groups were homogenous in terms of demographic characteristics. Further information is included in Table 8.1 .

10.
Calculate the mean ( 
X
¯
) for the pain scores in Question 9. Does this distribution of scores appear to be normal or skewed? Provide a rationale for your answer.

Answers to study questions

1.
The mode is the most frequently occurring score in a distribution of sample scores; thus it will always be an actual score in the distribution. Median is the middle score of the distribution, which, with an even number of items, may not be an actual score in the distribution. The mean is the average of all scores in the distribution of sample scores, so it is often not an actual score in the distribution ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

2.
Illiterate was the mode for the educational level of the entire sample ( N = 89). Illiterate was the mode for the intervention group ( n = 20) and for the control group ( n = 13). A total of 33 (37%) of the study participants marked illiterate as their educational level. With many of the participants being illiterate, this might have affected their ability to complete the measurement methods in this study. The researchers would have strengthened their study by providing the reading levels for the scales used ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). The comprehension of the video-based educational program might have been altered for the intervention group. However, educational level was not identified as a limitation for this study.

3.
The mean ages of the intervention ( 
X
¯
 = 56.34) and control ( 
X
¯
 = 60.18) groups were similar (see Table 8.1 ), because they varied by 3.84 years. In addition, the researchers conducted a t -test and determined the two groups were not significantly different for age.

4.
No, the mean SBP for the intervention group was 119.61 mm Hg, which does not reflect HTN. This value reflects a normal SBP according to BP guidelines ( Todkar et al., 2021 ; Whelton et al., 2018 ). You can calculate the range for the SBP for 68% of the study participants in the intervention group by adding and subtracting the standard deviation from the mean. For example, 119.61 ± 17.12 = the SBP range of a high of 136.73 mm Hg to a low of 102.49 mm Hg ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Thus 68% of the study participants had normal SBPs less than 140 mm Hg.

5.
No, a majority of the patients in the sample did not smoke. A total of 62 participants (33 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group) did not smoke, which was 69.7% of the sample. Thus smoking is not a risk factor for CVD as experienced by most of the study participants.

6.
Yes, Oshvandi et al. (2021 , p. 30) reported “The two groups were homogenous in terms of demographic characteristics.” In addition, Table 8.1 indicated that the intervention and control groups were not significantly different for any of the demographic characteristics examined in this study. The groups were similar or homogenous for the demographic characteristics at the start of the study. Homogenous groups reduce the potential for errors from extraneous variables ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

7.
The mean satisfaction score decreased over time from a high of 57.91 at 2 hours after the TCA to a low of 52.34 at 8 hours after TCA. This is a decline of 5.57 points on the PSQ used to measure satisfaction. The satisfaction level probably declined with the decreasing influence of the intervention over time.

8.
An unusually low score(s) or outlier(s) decreases the value of the mean, and an unusually high score(s) increases the mean value (see Fig. 8.2 ). The mean in a study is most affected by outliers ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). If the outliers cause the interval- or ratio-level data to be skewed or not normally distributed, it is best to report the median in a study. If the data are normally distributed, then the mean is the best measure of central tendency to report.

9.
Place the pain scores in order from the least to the greatest score: 1, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9. In this example, the mode or most frequently occurring score is 7, and the MD or middle score in the distribution is 7. The range for the pain scores is 1 to 9 or 9 − 1 = 8.

10.
X
¯
= (1 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 9) ÷ 10 = 66 ÷ 10 = 6.6. The mode equals the median (see the answer to Question 9), which is different than the mean ( 
X
¯
 = 6.6). In looking at the scores, the value of 1 might be an outlier in this small dataset. This outlier decreased the mean and potentially caused the distribution to be negatively skewed (see Fig. 8.2 ). In a negatively skewed distribution, the mode is equal to or similar to the MD and the mean is less than both. To determine whether this skewness is significant, the distribution of the data must be tested for normality. Exercise 27 provides the steps for determining the normality of a distribution of scores.

Statistical technique in review
Measures of dispersion , or measures of variability, are descriptive statistical techniques conducted to identify individual differences of the scores or values in a sample. These techniques give some indication of how values in a sample are dispersed, or spread, around the mean. The measures of dispersion also indicate how different the scores on a particular scale are or the extent that individual scores deviate from one another. If the individual scores are similar, dispersion or variability values are small and the sample is relatively homogeneous , or similar, in terms of these scores. A heterogeneous sample has a wide variation in the scores, resulting in increased values for the measures of dispersion. Range and standard deviation are the most common measures of dispersion included in research reports ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

The simplest measure of dispersion is the range . In published studies, range is presented in two ways: (1) the range includes the lowest and highest values obtained for a variable, or (2) the range is calculated by subtracting the lowest score from the highest score. For example, the range for the scores 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 19 might be reported as 8 to 19 (8–19). In this example, the range is used to identify the extremely high score, 19, in this distribution. Extremely high or low scores in a distribution are called outliers . The range can also be calculated as follows: 19 − 8 = 11. In this form, the range is a difference score that uses only the two extreme values in a sample for the comparison. The range is sometimes reported in published studies but is not used in further analyses ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

The standard deviation ( SD ) is a measure of dispersion that is the average number of points by which the scores or values of a distribution vary from the mean. It indicates the degree of error that would result if the mean alone were used to interpret the data for a variable in a study. Fig. 9.1 presents the normal curve with the SD values representing the variability of scores in the curve. In Fig. 9.1 , you note that the mean is zero (0) and each SD = 1, with 68.3% of the scores between −1 and +1 SD from the mean. A total of 95% of the scores for a variable in a study are between −1.96 and +1.96 SD from the mean. Values that are greater than +1.96 or −1.96 SD from the mean are significantly different at p = 0.05 when alpha (α) is set at 0.05. In a normal curve, 99% of the participants’ scores are between −2.58 and +2.58 SD s from the mean. Variable scores or values that are greater than +2.58 or −2.58 SD s are significant at p = 0.01 ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

A bell shaped graph of a normal distribution with percentages and z scores. The bell shaped graph represents a normal distribution. The curve is symmetrical about the vertical line at zero, labeled as mean, median, and mode. Horizontal lines indicate standard deviation ranges from the mean. The central range from minus 1 to plus 1 standard deviations covers 68.3 percent, the range from minus 2 to plus 2 standard deviations covers 95.5 percent, and the range from minus 3 to plus 3 standard deviations covers 99.7 percent. Below the curve, standard deviations are marked from minus 3 to plus 3. Additional z scores of minus 2.58, minus 1.96, plus 1.96, and plus 2.58 are labeled below the standard deviation markings. The right side of the diagram includes a vertical arrow labeled standard deviations or z-scores.
FIG. 9.1 ■
NORMAL CURVE WITH THE STANDARD DEVIATION ( SD ) VALUES REPRESENTING THE VARIABILITY OF SCORES IN THE CURVE.

The SD is an important statistic, both for understanding dispersion within a distribution and for interpreting the relationship of a particular value to the distribution. When the scores of a distribution deviate from the mean considerably, the SD or spread of scores is large. When the degree of deviation of scores from the mean is small, the SD or spread of the scores is small. The equation and steps for calculating the standard deviation are presented in Exercise 28 , which is focused on calculating descriptive statistics.

Introduction
Brino and colleagues (2022) conducted a quality improvement (QI) project to determine whether a social media hygiene education intervention designed for adolescents would improve their problematic Internet use (PIU) and their mental health status. The intervention was a 5-week educational program conducted via a telehealth system. PIU was measured using the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS-2). The GPIUS-2 is a 15-item Likert scale where adolescents self-reported their experiences on a scale ranging from 1, “Strongly Disagree,” to 7, “Strongly Agree.” The higher scores for GPIUS-2 indicated greater PIU and only the adolescents with a score of 52 or greater were offered the intervention in this study. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS), which is a 16-item Likert scale. Brino and colleagues (2022, pp. 86–87) reported: “The PHQ-ADS combines the 16 items to derive a depression and anxiety total score, ranging from 0 to 48. Total scores from the PHQ-ADS are often used to categorize severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as minimal (0–9), mild (10–19), moderate (20–29) or severe (30–48).” The researchers concluded that the social media hygiene protocol could be used to reduce the severity of PIU and to improve mental health outcomes in adolescents.

Relevant study results
“Methods
Design
A within-adolescent pre-post design was used to evaluate changes in social media usage and mental health outcomes among adolescents with PIU seeking outpatient mental health care who received an ad hoc social media hygiene education intervention administered by their provider.... Outcomes were measured at the participant’s initial clinical visit immediately preceding (pre-intervention) and immediately following completion of intervention (post-intervention)....

Setting
The setting for implementation was a nurse practitioner owned and fully staffed, pediatric outpatient behavioral health clinic in North Carolina. The clinic provides assessment and treatment for an average of 70–80 patients (aged 2–21 years) with mental and behavioral health conditions per week. Nearly half of the patients (46%) are adolescents between the age[s] of 12–18....

Intervention
The intervention entailed a patient-centered education protocol using current screen time recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics as well as visual materials from internet blogs that focused on reducing internet-use and increasing social media awareness. The intervention for each participant was comprised of five, one-hour telehealth sessions completed over the course of five weeks” ( Brino et al., 2022 , p. 85).

“Results
A total of 125 adolescents age of 12 to 19 years seeking outpatient behavioral health care were invited to complete the GPIUS-2 during the three-month recruitment period, January through March 2020. Among the 125 approached, 75 completed the pre-intervention assessment. None of the 125 had an intellectual disability diagnosis. The GPIUS-2 total scores ranged from 26 to 122, and 50 of the 75 adolescents had a positive PIU screen as indicated by a total score of ≥52. Of the 50 who met the eligibility criteria, 22 did not receive the intervention due to scheduling conflicts. Therefore, the analysis sample included 28 adolescents with PIU. All 28 completed the pre- and post-intervention assessments.

The mean age of the 28 participants was 14.2 ( SD = 1.9, range 12 to 17) years, consisting of primarily females (71.4%). The most common DSM-V [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5] mental health diagnoses among participants were anxiety (42.8%), depression (17.8%), ADHD [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder] (28.5%), and adjustment disorder with mixed emotions (10.7%).

Table 9.1 summarizes the PIU and mental health results at the pre- and post-assessments as well the pre-minus-post difference scores. A significant improvement (reduction) was demonstrated for screen time as measured by average hours per day in the past 7-days ( t = 10.14, df = 27, p < 0.001), severity of PIU as measured by the GPIUS-2 total scores ( t = 12.07, df = 27, p < 0.001), and severity of depression and/or anxiety as indicated by the PHQ-ADS total scores ( t = 8.3, df = 27, p < 0.001)” ( Brino et al., 2022 , p. 87).

Answers to study questions

1.
The 
X
¯
 is a measure of central tendency of a distribution, whereas the standard deviation ( SD ) is a measure of dispersion. Both the 
X
¯
 and SD are descriptive or summary statistics.

2.
Range is the simplest measure of dispersion or variability, obtained by identifying the lowest and highest scores in a distribution or by subtracting the lowest score from the highest score in the distribution of scores ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). For example, five study participants’ hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were 7.9, 7.4, 7.2, 7.8, and 7.6. The range for these scores would be 7.2 to 7.9 or 7.9 − 7.2 = 0.7. The range identifies the lowest score and highest score in a distribution so it can be used to identify outliers, which are extremely high or low scores compared with the other scores in a distribution ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

3.
The mean age of the 28 study participants was 14.2, with an SD of 1.9 and a range of ages from 12 to 17 years. The study included only adolescents and the average age of 14.2 seems appropriate for the sample studied. The SD is small, indicating a homogeneous group with minimal variation in age. The range indicated that only adolescents were included in the sample, with no outliers for age ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

4.
Approximately 68% of the study participants were between 12.3 and 16.1 years of age, which is usually recorded as (12.3, 16.1). Calculations: 68.3% sample = 
X
¯
 ± SD , which is 14.2 ± 1.9 = (12.3, 16.1) in this sample. The participants are all adolescents with a narrow range of ages.

5.
PIU was measured with the GPIUS-2 Likert scale that included self-reported ratings ranging from 1, “Strongly Disagree,” to 7, “Strongly Agree.” The total score for this 15-item scale was examined in this study (see Table 9.1 ). Likert scales include ordinal-level data; but if the scores from a multi-item scale are normally distributed, the data are analyzed as interval level (see Exercise 1 ; Bandalos, 2018 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

6.
The adolescents’ preintervention screen time, in hours per day, had a 
X
¯
 = 7.2, SD = 3.7, and a range of 2.0 to 16.0. The adolescents’ postintervention screen time, in hours per day, had a 
X
¯
 = 4.0, SD = 2.8, and a range of 0.5 to 11.0. The preintervention and postintervention difference is presented in Table 9.1 as 
X
¯
 = 3.2, SD = 1.7, and a range of 0.0 to 7.0. After the social media hygiene intervention, the mean screen time declined by 3 hours per day. The SD and range also declined after the intervention, indicating less variability in the adolescents’ screen time values.

7.
In examining Table 9.1 , the screen time minimal value postintervention was 0.5, which might be an outlier. Further examination of the data is needed to determine outliers for the dependent variables. However, if outliers were identified, they did not affect the distribution of scores because scores for all three dependent variables were normally distributed. Brino et al. (2022, p. 87) reported in the key for Table 9.1 that the “pre-post difference skewness scores were less than 0.20,” so the data for all variables were normally distributed.

8.
Yes, the adolescents’ screen time in hours per day changed significantly from preintervention to postintervention as indicated by “ t = 10.14, df = 27, p < 0.001” ( Brino et al., 2022 , p. 87). The p value is less than α, set at 0.05 for this study, indicating the results were significant for this variable ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

9.
In the Brino et al. (2022) study, the range for screen time hours per day for 95% of the adolescents after the intervention was from a low of −1.49 to a high of 9.49 (−1.49, 9.49). The negative number of screen time hours (−1.49) is confusing and would rarely be found in a study. When this kind of calculation happens, it is usually due to a nonnormal distribution and/or a small sample size (which is the case here with N = 28).

Calculations: 95% sample scores = 
X
¯
 ± (1.96 × SD ). In this study, 4.00 ± (1.96 × 2.80) = 4.00 ± 5.49 = (−1.49, 9.49) in this sample.
10.
“The most common DSM-V [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5] mental health diagnoses among participants were anxiety (42.8%), depression (17.8%), ADHD [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder] (28.5%), and adjustment disorder with mixed emotions (10.7%)” ( Brino et al., 2022 , p. 87). The percentages of adolescents with mental health diagnoses were high, especially for anxiety and ADHD. Mental health issues are a severe problem for adolescents that have a link to screen time. PIU and mental health issues require assessment and management by nurses in schools and clinical settings.

Statistical technique in review
Most research reports describe the participants who compose the study sample. This description of the sample is called the sample characteristics. These characteristics are often presented in a table and narrative within the research report. Data are collected for demographic and clinical variables to describe the sample. Demographic variables are attribute variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity collected to describe a sample and as a basis for comparison with the demographic characteristics in other studies. Clinical variables are selective physical, emotional, and cognitive variables collected and analyzed to describe the specific clinical characteristics of the study sample. The sample characteristics might be presented for the entire sample or for the different groups in a study (e.g., intervention and control groups) ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kazdin, 2022 ). If a study includes an intervention group and a comparison or control group, the demographic and clinical characteristics for these two groups are usually compared prior to the conduct of the study. The groups need to be similar at the start of the study to decrease the potential for extraneous variables altering the effect of the intervention on the dependent variables ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Shadish et al., 2002 ).

The descriptive statistics conducted to generate the sample characteristics depend on the level of measurement of the demographic and clinical variables included in a study (see Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). For example, data collected on gender are nominal level and can be described using frequencies, percentages, and mode (see Exercises 6 and 8 ). Measuring an educational level usually produces ordinal data that can be described using frequencies, percentages, mode, median, and range. Obtaining each participant’s specific age is an example of ratio data that can be described using mean, median, range, and standard deviation (see Exercise 9 ). Interval and ratio data are analyzed with the same statistical techniques and are sometimes referred to as interval- or ratio-level data in this text.

Introduction
Riegel and colleagues (2018) conducted a longitudinal sequential explanatory mixed methods study to examine the symptom perceptions of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). A mixed methods study includes both quantitative and qualitative research methods. An exploratory sequential design begins with the collection and analysis of qualitative data, followed by the collection of quantitative data. Often, findings of the qualitative data analyses are used to design the quantitative phase ( Creswell & Clark, 2018 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Riegel et al. (2018) enrolled a small sample of 36 HF patients to allow depth rather than breadth of data collected ( Creswell & Creswell, 2023 ; Creswell & Poth, 2018 ). “Maximum variability was sought in participant age, gender, HF duration and severity, and comorbidity” to promote understanding of HF patients’ perceptions and management of their symptoms ( Riegel et al., 2018 , p. 108). The researchers collected demographic data such as age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, race, employment, marital status, and self-reported income. Likert scales were used to collect data on depression, decision-making, and self-care maintenance and management. “Clinical characteristics (e.g. such as HF duration, type, ejection fraction) were abstracted from the medical record” ( Riegel et al., 2018 , p. 109). Other clinical data such as cognitive function, comorbidity, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were also collected to describe the patients with HF.

Riegel et al. (2018) determined “that although some HF patients had systems in place for monitoring their symptoms, problems with symptom detection were evident, interpretation was poor, and problems in management delayed response.... Notably, even the most savvy patients in this sample were not able to avoid a HF hospitalization. Further research is greatly needed on this topic if we are to achieve the goal of rapid response to signs and symptoms and early medical intervention in patients with HF, thereby decreasing HF hospitalization” ( Riegel et al., 2018 , p. 113).

Relevant study results
“After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we enrolled a sample of community dwelling HF patients from outpatient settings affiliated with two university hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. All participants gave written informed consent. We collected baseline and 3-month data during home visits. Biweekly, participants were telephoned to ask about their symptoms over the past week. Those who had experienced symptoms were interviewed in depth” ( Riegel et al., 2018 , p. 108).

“Results
The enrolled sample of 36 was predominately male (67%), older (64 ± 15.2 years), White (61%), and functionally compromised (56% NYHA class III), with a moderate level of comorbidity (42%). See Table 10.1 . Seven participants withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the final home visit, but only one withdrew early, so a rich dataset was available on each of these participants.

At enrollment, self-care was poor overall. Self-care maintenance scores were barely adequate (mean 69.8 ± 13.5, range 33–93). Self-care management scores (64.4 ± 18.9, range 35–90) and self-care confidence were low (mean 68.4 ± 19.1, range 17–100) as well. The HFSPS [Heart Failure Somatic Perception Scale] total score was low (mean 8.1 ± 10.6, range 0–51), the HFSPS Dyspnea subscale score was also low (mean 1.8 ± 3.7, range 0–15), as was the daily diary fatigue score (mean 4.1 ± 6.6, range 0–24), indicating that few were symptomatic on enrollment. Within the 3-month follow-up period, four participants were admitted to the hospital for HF; two of these four were admitted twice” ( Riegel et al., 2018 , p. 109).

Answers to study questions

1.
Age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status are demographic variables that were described in this study. Riegel et al. (2018) identified these as demographic variables in the study narrative and in Table 10.1 . Yes, these are common demographic variables described by nurses and other health professionals in their studies. Researchers can compare their sample characteristics with those from other studies including these variables ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). Federal grant guidelines often encourage researchers to describe their sample with these common demographic variables (see National Institute of Nursing Research website at https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/desp/oep/fundingopportunities ).

2.
Age is measured at the ratio level because the specific age of each patient in years was obtained. Age in years is a continuous variable where each year equals 12 months or 365 days. Age has an absolute zero where 0 years old indicates the absence of age (see Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). The data collected for gender in this study include two categories, male and female. These categories are basically exhaustive and mutually exclusive because all study participants fit into one category. Male and female gender cannot be ranked, so the data are nominal.

3.
Mean ( 
X
¯
) and standard deviation ( SD ) were computed to describe the variable of age because it was measured at the ratio level. Ratio-level data are best analyzed with parametric statistics, such as 
X
¯
 and SD (see Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Frequencies and percentages were calculated to describe the variable of gender. The data for gender are nominal-level measurements, so frequencies and percentages are appropriate (see Exercise 6 ). The researchers might have also identified the mode, which was male (66.7% or 67%) for this sample ( Waltz et al., 2017 ).

4.
The mode for marital status was married, which included 24 participants (66.7%). The mode is the measure of central tendency for analyzing nominal-level data. Mode is defined as the numerical value or score that occurs with the greatest frequency in a dataset (see Exercise 8 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

5.
The quality of support variable is measured at the ordinal level. The measurement of quality of support was achieved using four categories (i.e., poor, fair, good, and very good) that can be ranked from a low of poor to a high of very good. These categories can be ranked but do not have equal intervals between the categories as with interval-level data (see Exercise 1 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ).

6.
The quality of support variable was described with frequencies and percentages. Frequencies and percentages are appropriate analyses, but the data for quality of support are at the ordinal level and additional analyses of median and range could have been calculated to expand the description of this variable ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

7.
Riegel et al. (2018) analyzed perceived health data as though at the ordinal level. Frequencies and percentages were calculated but not 
X
¯
 or SD ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Waltz et al., 2017 ). Perceived health was organized into four categories (i.e., poor, fair, good, and very good) that are exhaustive and exclusive. Perceived health levels can be ranked from a low of poor to a high of very good. However, perceived health was not considered a continuous variable in this study ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

8.
Yes, the sample was adequately described for common demographic variables such as age, socioeconomic status, gender, race, education, employment, marital status, and self-reported income. Clinical characteristics were also detailed for this group of patients with HF, including depression, HF duration, quality of support, perceived health, categorized Charlson Comorbidity Index, common comorbid conditions, and NYHA class (see Table 10.1 ). The descriptive data analyses were appropriate for the level of measurement of the demographic and clinical variables, including frequencies and percentages for nominal- and ordinal-level data and ( 
X
¯
) and SD for ratio-level data. The description of these demographic and clinical variables provided a detailed picture of the sample in Table 10.1 that was supplemented by the study narrative.

9.
“The dyspnea subscale score was also low (mean 1.8 ± 3.7, range 0–15)” (Riegel et al., 2018, p. 109). Yes, the distribution of dyspnea data appeared to have an outlier because the mean was 1.8 and the top score in the range is 15 (see Exercise 9 ). The score of 15 is much higher than the mean and is probably an outlier. However, the distribution of scores needs to be examined further for outliers and normality of the distribution (see Exercise 27 ).

10.
No, the self-care confidence scores in this study were not strong. Riegel et al. (2018, p. 109) stated the “self-care confidence scores were low (mean 68.4 ± 19.1, range 17–100).” Low self-confidence scores are clinically important because they indicate the uncertainty and probable problems these patients and family members are having in assessing and managing their HF symptoms. These patients need additional support and education to improve their self-confidence and possibly decrease their HF symptoms and reduce their need for hospitalization.

Statistical technique in review
Scatterplots or scattergrams are used to describe relationships between two variables and to provide a graphic representation of data from a study. Variables are illustrated on two axes, x and y. The x -axis is the horizontal axis, and the y -axis is the vertical axis (see Fig. 11.1 ). To provide a visual image of the data, each point on the graph is a participant’s values for variables x and y, thus representing the relationship between these variables on the graph. Each participant’s values on the two variables are plotted on the graph, and the number of points on the graph depends on the study sample size ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ). In the example scatterplot in Fig. 11.1 , there are 20 points, so this example includes a sample of 20 participants.

A scatterplot with dots shows a positive trend. The diagram is a scatterplot with a horizontal axis labeled x axis and a vertical axis labeled y axis. Small filled dots are evenly distributed across the chart area and generally increase from the bottom left to the top right, to form an upward trend. There are no gridlines, tick marks, or numerical values on the axes, and the plot only includes the labeled axes and data points.
FIG. 11-1 ■
FORMAT FOR A SCATTERPLOT.

Direction and strength of relationships in scatterplots
The display of points on the scatterplot graph indicates the direction (i.e., positive or negative) and strength (i.e., weak, moderate, or strong) of the relationship between the two variables studied. Scatterplot points moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner illustrate a positive or direct linear relationship . In a positive relationship the variables being correlated vary together in the same direction. When one variable value increases, the other variable value increases, or when one variable decreases, the other variable decreases. Fig. 11.2 identifies a positive relationship between the variables of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and grams of dietary fat consumed a day: as the grams of fat consumed increase, so does the LDL cholesterol value. The line through the points on the graph identifies the direction or nature of the relationship ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

A scatterplot shows a positive relationship between L D L cholesterol and grams of dietary fat. The diagram is a scatterplot with the horizontal axis labeled L D L cholesterol and the vertical axis labeled grams of dietary fat. Both axes display numerical values, with the horizontal axis ranges from 75 to 200 and the vertical axis ranges from 40 to 80. Small filled dots are distributed across the plot area, and a solid straight line passes diagonally upward from the lower left to the upper right, indicates a positive relationship. The dots are scattered around the line, show variation in the data while generally follow the upward trend.
FIG. 11.2 ■
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL AND GRAMS OF DIETARY FAT CONSUMED ( N = 24).

In a negative or inverse linear relationship , the values for two variables vary in the opposite or inverse direction; as the values for one variable increase, the values for the other variable decrease. In a negative relationship the points on the scatterplot move from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. Fig. 11.3 demonstrates a negative relationship between the variables of perceived stress level and minutes of walking. An increase in minutes of walking is associated with a decrease in perceived stress level ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ).

A scatterplot shows a negative relationship between perceived stress level and minutes of walking. The diagram is a scatterplot with the horizontal axis labeled perceived stress level and the vertical axis labeled minutes of walking. The horizontal axis ranges from 0 to 100 and the vertical axis ranges from 0 to 80. Multiple small filled dots are scattered across the plot area. A solid straight line passes diagonally downward from the upper left to the lower right, indicates a negative relationship. The distribution of dots generally follows the downward slope of the line, suggest that higher perceived stress levels correspond to fewer minutes of walking.
FIG. 11.3 ■
NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINUTES OF WALKING AND PERCEIVED STRESS LEVEL ( N = 25).

The strength or magnitude of the relationships shown in scatterplots range from −1 to +1, with −1 indicating a perfect negative relationship between two variables and +1 indicating a perfect positive relationship between two variables. Pearson r (see Exercises 13 and 29 ) is calculated to determine the strength of the relationship between two continuous variables or variables measured at the interval or ratio level (see Exercise 1 ). The strengths of relationships are determined using the absolute value of the r . A weak relationship is <0.30, a moderate relationship is 0.30 to 0.50, and a strong relationship is >0.50. ( Cohen, 1988 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Plichta & Kelvin, 2013 ). The closer the plotted points are to each other and the more they approximate a straight line, the stronger the linear relationship between the two variables (see Figs. 11.2 and 11.3 ). Conversely, if the plotted points are further away from each other and widespread across the graph, this indicates a weak relationship that is closer to 0. The widespread data points in Fig. 11.4 demonstrate a relationship approximately equal to 0, or no relationship ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ). A scatterplot visually represents a relationship between two variables, but Pearson r correlational analysis must be calculated to determine the specific value for the strength of the relationship and to determine statistical significance ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

A scatterplot shows no clear relationship between horizontal axis and vertical axis values. The diagram is a scatterplot with the horizontal axis and the vertical axis. The graph area is divided into two halves by a horizontal line runs across the center. Multiple small filled dots are scattered across the entire graph without formation of any visible pattern or trend. The dots are evenly distributed above and below the central horizontal line, indicate no apparent correlation between the values on the horizontal axis and vertical axis.
FIG. 11.4 ■
SCATTERPLOT OF A RELATIONSHIP APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO 0.0.

Identifying outliers by developing a scatterplot
When looking at scatterplots, it is important to identify outliers. Outliers are extreme values in the dataset that occur with inherent variability, measurement error, sampling error, and errors in study implementation. Outliers are exceptions to the overall findings of a study that can affect the normality of the distribution and result in a skewed set of data (see Exercises 8 and 27 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). Fig. 11.2 has an example of two outliers in the lower right corner of the graph. These values represent participants with high LDL cholesterol values close to 200, whose consumption of dietary fat is 40 to 45 grams per day. Researchers use scatterplots to identify linear and nonlinear relationships, but the focus of this exercise is understanding linear relationships ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

Introduction
Faria and colleagues (2022) conducted a prospective longitudinal study to examine the association of right ventricular diastolic diameter (RVDD) with exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, and exacerbation periods for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This observational study included 91 patients diagnosed with COPD who were stratified into two groups, those with RVDD greater than 35 mm and those with RVDD less than 35 mm. All participants were clinically assessed using echocardiography to determine RVDD, spirometry to measure pulmonary function of forced vital capacity (FVC), and the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) to determine exercise tolerance. These patients were followed for 12 months through telephone calls and medical consultation every 3 months. Faria et al. (2022) concluded that increased RVDD was associated with decreased pulmonary function and exercise tolerance and increased exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Relevant study results
“Statistical analysis
The required number of patients to be assessed is n = 40, being necessary 20 patients for each group evaluated, assuming a risk of α of 5%, effect size 0.6 and β of 0.95. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify the normality of the data. Descriptive variables were listed as mean, standard deviation, and percentage (%). To test the hypothesis of our study, we applied: (1) The Student’s t -test for comparison between patients with exacerbation vs no-exacerbation; (2) The Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the correlations between variables, and (3) A linear regression model was used to determine the influence of RVDD on distance in 6MWT. A p value ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant for all tests, and all tests were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 ( GraphPad Software, California, USA ).

Results
This study included 91 eligible patients. In the one-year follow-up, 25 (17%) patients had exacerbation and hospitalization for COPD.... The patients were predominantly classified as GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] II (40%) and III (36%) COPD severities. The included patients were also stratified according to RVDD greater and less than 35 mm.... It was found that patients with RVDD greater than 35 mm had worse FC [functional capacity] in the 6MWT ( p = 0.05), with no significant difference in age. Additionally, these patients had more exacerbation during the one-year follow-up ( p = 0.05).

There was a statistically significant correlation of the... predicted FVC and the RVDD ( r = −0.26; p = 0.02) in patients with COPD exacerbation ( Fig. 11.5 , p < 0.05), demonstrating that the larger the RVDD, the worse the pulmonary function. Additionally, there was a statistically significant correlation between the 6MWT and the RVDD ( R = −0.55; p = 0.03) in COPD patients with exacerbations, which means the larger the RVDD, the worse the FC in these individuals ( Fig. 11.6 )” ( Faria et al., 2022 , pp. 12–13).

A scatterplot shows a negative correlation between F V C and R V D D in C O P D patients.

“Discussion
The main point observed in this study was that diameters of RVDD greater than 35 mm were associated with worse FC and more frequent exacerbation of the disease in the one-year follow-up. Patients with COPD, in addition to frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations, may progress to ventricular dysfunction and right heart failure....

The main clinical implication for the future practice of this study is that the RVDD may be a good echocardiographic variable to monitor [in] COPD patients who need more aggressive therapeutic strategies as a way to prevent hospitalization for exacerbation, and to identify patients who may benefit from inclusion in a pulmonary rehabilitation program with the aim of improving FC.

Further studies are necessary to investigate prospectively echocardiographic variables, including the RVDD, as potential predictors of unfavorable outcomes in COPD patients” ( Faria et al., pp. 13–14).

Answers to study questions

1.
A scatterplot is used to describe a relationship between two variables and provides a graphic representation of the data collected on these two variables from study participants. The elements included in a scatterplot are presented in Fig. 11.1 . These elements include an x -axis with the name of one variable and a y -axis with the name of the other variable examined for association. The points that represent the participants’ values for two study variables are plotted on the scatterplot ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Terrell, 2021 ).

2.
Fig. 11.2 shows a positive or direct relationship between the LDL cholesterol and grams of dietary fat. The plotted points move from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, indicating a positive relationship where the two variables change in the same direction. Therefore a decrease in LDL cholesterol is associated with a decrease in grams of dietary fat, or vice versa, an increase in grams of dietary fat is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. Normally, individuals consume about 55 to 70 grams of dietary fat a day.

3.
Outliers are extreme values in the dataset that occur with inherent variability, measurement error, sampling error, and errors in study implementation. Outliers are exceptions to the overall study results that can affect the normality of a distribution ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

4.
Yes, Fig. 11.2 has two outliers in the right lower corner above the LDL cholesterol value of 200. These participants’ values are very different than the others on the scatterplot because they consume diets low in fat and have high LDL cholesterol values. The distribution of data in a study should be tested for normality before implementing inferential statistics. LDL cholesterol and grams of dietary fat are measured at the ratio level; so, if the scores are normally distributed, parametric analyses can be conducted ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ).

5.
Fig. 11.3 illustrates a negative relationship. The points in this scatterplot extend from the left upper corner to the right lower corner, which is typical of a negative relationship. In this graph, minutes of walking is negatively associated with perceived stress level. Thus as the minutes of walking increase, the participants’ perceived stress levels decrease.

6.
Yes, by looking at a scatterplot you can know the approximate strength of a relationship. With strong relationships, the plotted points are close together and located on or close to the line drawn through the points. A moderate relationship has increased spacing among the points and varying distance of the points from the line drawn through them. Weak relationships have varied spacing of the points with no clear direction as the r value approaches 0.0 (see Fig. 11.4 ). Thus Fig. 11.3 approximates a strong relationship based on the placement of the points to each other and the line. However, the specific strength of the relationship between two variables is determined with Pearson r correlational analysis and is what is presented in a research report ( Terrell, 2021 ).

7.
Fig. 11.4 approximates a very weak or no relationship because the plotted points are widespread and do not form a direction for the relationship. For example, a person’s cognitive score would not be expected to have an association with their number of siblings. Thus the relationship would be weak and close to 0.0.

8.
In the Faria et al. (2022) study, the note under Fig. 11.5 identified that the graph included the scores from 76 patients with COPD. Thus the plotted points are the scores or values for each participant’s RVDD in mm and FVC in percentages.

9.
In Fig. 11.5 of the Faria et al. (2022) study, the variable on the x -axis is RVDD in mm, and the variable on the y -axis is FVC in percentage (%). These might also be referred to as the x -variable and y -variable. Fig. 11.5 is a negative relationship because the data points extend from the left upper corner of the graph to the right lower corner of the graph and the reported r = −0.265.

10.
The strength of the relationship in Fig. 11.5 is r = −0.265, which is a weak relationship (<0.30 in absolute value) ( Cohen, 1988 ; Grove & Gray, 2023 ). The r value is significant because p = 0.020 is less than the alpha = 0.05 set for this study. The study results identified a weak, negative association of the participants’ RVDD with their FVC. When the participants’ RVD

Statistical technique in review
Multiple factors are involved in determining the appropriateness of the inferential statistical techniques reported in nursing studies. Inferential statistics are conducted to examine relationships, make predictions, and determine differences among groups or variables in studies. When conducting data analyses for their studies, researchers consider many aspects of the study, including the study purpose, hypotheses or questions, level of measurement of the variables, design, and number of groups studied. Determining the appropriateness of the various inferential statistics reported for a particular study is not straightforward. Often, there is not necessarily one right statistical technique for a study.

One approach for judging the appropriateness of a statistical technique in a study is to use an algorithm or decision tree. The algorithm directs you by gradually narrowing the number of statistical techniques as you make judgments about the nature of the study and the data. An algorithm for judging the suitability of statistical procedures in studies is presented in Fig. 12.1 . This algorithm was developed by the coauthor of this text, Daisha Cipher. Fig. 12.1 includes the four key factors related to the appropriateness of a statistical technique:

1.
Nature of the research question or hypothesis (focus on differences or associations/relationships) for a study

2.
Level of measurement (i.e., nominal, ordinal, or interval/ratio) of the dependent or research variables

3.
Number of groups studied

4.
Research design element (i.e., independent or paired samples)

A decision tree for selection of statistical techniques in nursing studies. The diagram is a vertical flowchart titled Algorithm or decision tree to determine appropriate statistical techniques for nursing studies. It begins at the top with three rectangular boxes aligned horizontally that read Nature of research question or hypothesis, Measurement of independent and dependent variables, and Number of groups per variable. Below these, the flowchart branches into two main categories Difference and Association or relationship. Under the Difference category, there are three levels of measurement listed vertically which are Nominal, Ordinal, and Interval or ratio. Each level is further divided based on the number of groups which are One group, Two groups, and More than two groups. For Nominal data under Difference, one group leads to an independent sample and uses the Chi square goodness of fit test. Two groups are divided into independent sample which uses the Chi square test of independence and Fisher exact test, dependent sample which uses the McNemar test, and matched sample which uses the Chi square test of independence. More than two groups with an independent sample use the Chi square test of independence. For Ordinal data under Difference, one group with an independent sample uses the Sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Two groups are divided into independent sample which uses the Mann Whitney U test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, dependent sample which uses the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and matched sample which uses the Sign test. More than two groups with an independent sample use the Kruskal Wallis test. For Interval or ratio data under Difference, one group with a dependent sample uses the Paired t test. Two groups are divided into independent sample which uses the Independent t test and Welch t test, dependent sample which uses the Paired t test, and matched sample which uses the Wilcoxon signed rank test. More than two groups with an independent sample use the Analysis of variance. Under the Association or relationship category, the three measurement levels are again Nominal, Ordinal, and Interval or ratio. For Nominal data with one group, the Chi square test of independence is used followed by coefficients such as Contingency coefficient, Phi, and Cramer V. For Ordinal data with one group, the Spearman correlation is used. For Interval or ratio data with one group, the Pearson product moment correlation is used and leads to Simple and multiple linear regression. The entire diagram consists of rectangular boxes arranged in vertical and horizontal sequences with connecting lines that guide the user through decision paths based on the nature of research, type of variables, and number of groups.

Evaluating the statistical techniques reported in a study requires you to make several judgments about the nature of the data and what the researchers wanted to know. The study purpose and research questions or hypotheses need to be examined to determine whether the focus of the study was examining associations or relationships, making predictions, or determining group differences. Research questions are often used to direct descriptive and correlational studies. However, quasi-experimental and experimental studies focused on determining the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment are best directed by hypotheses ( Grove & Gray, 2023 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Shadish et al., 2002 ).

You also need to determine whether the study variables were measured at the nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio level (see Fig. 12.1 ; review Exercise 1 ). You might see statistical techniques identified as parametric or nonparametric, depending on the level of measurement of the study variables. Nonparametric statistics are usually conducted for variables measured at the nominal or ordinal levels ( Pett, 2016 ). If the study variables are measured at either the interval or ratio levels and the values of the variables for the study participants are normally distributed, then parametric statistics are conducted (see Exercise 1 ; Kim et al., 2022 ). Remember the analysis techniques are the same whether the data use interval or ratio levels of measurement. Researchers run a computer program to determine whether the dependent variables’ frequency distributions are normally distributed (see Exercise 27 ). If the distribution of values or scores collected for a dependent variable are not normally distributed or are skewed, then nonparametric statistics are conducted even though the variables were measured at the interval or ratio level ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2022 ).

In Fig. 12.1 , examination of the research design element involves determining whether the samples or groups in a study are independent or paired. With independent samples or groups , the assignment of one study participant to a group is unrelated to the assignment of other participants to groups. For example, if participants are randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups, the samples are independent. In paired samples (also called dependent samples or groups), participants or observations selected for data collection are related in some way to the selection of other participants or observations. For example, if study participants serve as their own control by using their pretest data as a control group, the observations and therefore the groups are paired. Some studies require repeated measures of the dependent variable on the same group of participants, resulting in paired samples ( Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ).

To apply the algorithm in Fig. 12.1 , you would perform the steps previously introduced: (1) determine whether the research question or hypothesis focuses on differences or associations (i.e., relationships); (2) determine the level of measurement (i.e., nominal, ordinal, or interval/ratio) of the study variables; (3) select the number of groups that were included in the study; and (4) determine the design, with either independent or paired samples, that most closely fits the study you are critically appraising. The lines on the algorithm are followed through each selection to identify an appropriate statistical technique for the data being analyzed. The recommended statistic is identified in the far-right column in Fig. 12.1 .

Regression analysis is focused on the prediction of a dependent variable using one or more independent variables. A study with one dependent variable (i.e., outcome) and one independent variable (i.e., predictor) is analyzed using simple linear regression (see Exercises 14 and 30 ). If the study has one dependent variable and more than one independent variable, then the data are analyzed with multiple linear regression (see Exercises 15 and 31 ; Gray & Grove, 2021 ; Kazdin, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2022 ; Terrell, 2021 ).
