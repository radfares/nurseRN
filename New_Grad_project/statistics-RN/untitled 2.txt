  This is GOLD for your agents!

  This material directly maps to what your Data Analysis Agent needs to do:
  - Select appropriate statistical tests
  - Validate sample sizes
  - Check assumptions
  - Handle missing data
  - Interpret results

  Integration Options

  Option A: RAG Knowledge Base (Recommended)

  Agno supports knowledge bases that agents can search

  How it works:
  1. Load these .md files as a knowledge base
  2. Data Analysis Agent queries it when answering statistical questions
  3. Agent retrieves relevant passages and cites the textbook

  Pros: Dynamic, searchable, cites sources
  Cons: Requires embedding setup

  ---
  Option B: Structured Reference Database

  How it works:
  1. Parse content into SQLite tables:
    - statistical_tests (name, when_to_use, assumptions, formula)
    - measurement_levels (level, examples, valid_tests)
    - decision_rules (scenario, recommendation)
  2. Agent queries database for specific guidance

  Pros: Fast lookups, deterministic
  Cons: Requires parsing/structuring work

  ---
  Option C: Enhanced Agent Instructions

  How it works:
  1. Extract key decision trees from the material
  2. Embed directly in Data Analysis Agent system prompt
  3. Agent uses rules without external lookup

  Example extracted rule:
  IF measurement_level == "nominal" AND groups == 2:
      RETURN "Chi-square test"
  ELIF measurement_level == "interval" AND groups == 2:
      RETURN "Independent t-test"

  Pros: Simple, no infrastructure
  Cons: Limited by context window size

  ---
  Option D: Hybrid Approach (Best)

  Combine options:
  1. Core rules → Embedded in agent instructions (fast)
  2. Detailed explanations → RAG knowledge base (searchable)
  3. Examples/exercises → Database for practice scenarios

  ---
  My Recommendation

  Start with Option C (Enhanced Instructions), then add Option A (RAG) later:

  1. Phase 1: Extract the statistical test decision tree from Nominal.md and add to Data Analysis Agent instructions
  2. Phase 2: Add the correlation interpretation rules from statspart2.md
  3. Phase 3: Set up Agno knowledge base for full document search

  This gives you immediate value without infrastructure changes.

  Quick Win Example

  From Nominal.md, I can extract this decision logic for your agent:

  STATISTICAL TEST SELECTION:

  Nominal data (categorical):
    - 2 groups → Chi-square test
    - Correlation → Not applicable (use Spearman if ordinal)

  Ordinal data (ranked):
    - 2 groups → Mann-Whitney U
    - Correlation → Spearman rho
    - Paired samples → Wilcoxon Signed-Rank

  Interval/Ratio data (continuous):
    - 2 groups → Independent t-test (or paired t-test)
    - Correlation → Pearson r
    - 3+ groups → ANOVA
    - Multiple predictors → Multiple regression
