The scientific research process involves the following steps: 1) pose a research question and hypothesis, 2) develop and implement a research plan, 3) perform data collection and analysis, and 4) prepare a research report.6 Each of these steps is critical for scientific inquiry. The research question or hypothesis dictates the research plans and data collection. Often practical and scientific considerations necessitate overlap of these steps of research process. The following description uses clinical and translational research framework to explain the research steps: (Figure 1-1).

The first step in the scientific research process is to pose a research question and a hypothesis. It is important to develop a research question that needs empirical investigation. The commonly used sources for a research question are clinical practice, policy, current issue, literature, or theory. The desirable characteristics of a research question are that it is feasible, interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant (FINER).14 Practical considerations, such as funding, expertise, environment, and access to patient care data, are also important to address the feasibility of the research. The novelty aspect of the research question can be evaluated by conducting a literature review. The goal of the research is to add something new to the existing evidence base. The ethical principles of research are governed by local institutional review boards and federal regulations. This requires appropriate regulatory approvals to conduct clinical research. Research relevant to the pharmacy profession should have strong implications for pharmaceutical practice and policy. Research that is not relevant will have limited value to stakeholders such as patients, providers, payers, and policy makers. These considerations will not only help formulate a good research question but also ensure a valuable contribution is made to evidence-based practice and policy (Box 1-1).

BOX 1-1: RESEARCH QUESTION AND HYPOTHESIS

The population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timeline, and setting (PICOTS) framework is often used to develop a good clinical question. This framework is ideal to compare interventions such as medications, devices, clinical services, policies, and programs. It also provides the components of a research question.15,16 The PICOTS framework requires the research question to identify: population to be studied, intervention to be applied, comparator to be used, outcomes to be evaluated, timeline to evaluate the outcomes, and healthcare setting of interest (Figure 1-2).

The population of interest can be grouped based on age, disease, or location. The intervention is usually a pharmaceutical product or service. The comparator can be an active medication/service or a placebo based on the goals of the research. The economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) are usually evaluated in pharmaceutical practice and policy research.17 Costs of direct and indirect medical care are often included as economic outcomes. Clinical outcomes include morbidity and mortality measures that represent safety and effectiveness of treatment. Humanistic outcomes include patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life and functional status. The timeline for research can be short-term or long-term based on the expected impact of pharmaceutical products or services.

In addition to comparative research framework, research can be classified as descriptive or analytical. Descriptive research describes or explores characteristics of a population such as the prevalence of a disease. Analytical research evaluates the relationship between two or more variables. Hypothesis specifies an expected relationship that is being evaluated between intervention/and outcome, or two or more variables. The hypothesis is often based on existing theories. The pathophysiology of the disease and pharmacology of the medication provide the rationale for expected effects of the pharmaceutical product. The expected relationship between clinical intervention and outcomes is usually postulated based on sociobehavioral theories. Research hypothesis is not usually specified in descriptive or exploratory research.

Developing and implementing a research plan requires a strong understanding of the principles of clinical research. Research plans include specific details of research design and methodology. Grant proposals have other requirements, such as timeline and funding details, in addition to research plans. These plans are implemented after the necessary approvals by the local institutional review boards. Research design refers to the overall plan that allows researchers to address study questions and test study hypotheses.18 The research designs can be broadly categorized into two types—experimental and observational designs. Experimental designs such as randomized controlled trials are the strongest study designs to test research hypotheses. The randomized designs are considered the gold standard in clinical research and are used to evaluate drug safety and efficacy. Observational research such as cohort or cross-sectional studies provides the evidence of associations or relationship. The evidence from observational research is generally weaker than that of randomized controlled trials due to scientific considerations such as confounding and biases. Study design provides a structural framework for experimental or observational research.6 Various other study designs are available to address the research question; the goal is to select the best design that fits the research question.

Research methodology provides details of data collection and measurement techniques.6 The definitions and the measurement process of intervention and outcomes are specified in the methods. Research methods are broadly grouped as primary methods and secondary methods. Primary methods collect data specifically for the research question using techniques such as self-reported observations and biological assessments; examples include surveys and laboratory tests. These are often collected prospectively, that is, data are collected after the study onset. Secondary methods involve the use of data that was collected for other purposes such as patient care or reimbursement; examples include medical charts and medical claims. These are retrospective in nature which means data were collected based on past events or already existing sources. Prospective methods are generally considered superior to retrospective methods as the researcher controls the data collection methods. The goal of research methods is to collect research data that are reliable (consistent) and valid (accurate). Researchers have a choice of research methods; the goal is to select the most appropriate method to collect the data. (Box 1-2).

BOX 1-2: RESEARCH PLAN

Design:

Choe HM et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of clinical services by pharmacists on glycemic control and other process measures in diabetes patients.

Irons BK et al. used a retrospective cohort design to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of clinical services by a pharmacist in primary care for patients with diabetes.

Methods:

Choe HM et al. prospectively collected data on glycosylated hemoglobin using a high-performance liquid chromatography machine and other secondary outcomes were collected using chart review.

Irons BK et al. used secondary data like medical charts to collect data related to glycosylated hemoglobin and other secondary outcomes for the study population.

The research design and methodology define the data management and analysis plans. Data collected from all sources should be recorded at the patient level or other units of analysis to conduct appropriate statistical analyses. Data collected from surveys and laboratory tests should be gathered and coded accordingly. Similarly, data from secondary sources should also be extracted and coded in accordance with the analysis plan. Although data collection seems easy, it is often tedious and time consuming as any error can undermine the data integrity and subsequent steps in the research including statistical analyses. Statistical analysis provides the quantitative answers to the research question. It is a tool to organize, summarize, and analyze research data. Several descriptive and inferential statistics are used to analyze the data. The descriptive measures such as means, medians, and modes are often used to summarize study sample characteristics. Inferential statistics such as the t-test and analysis of variance are used to make inference or draw conclusions based on the data collected. The appropriate statistical test is selected based on the research question, research hypothesis, research design, and methods. (Box 1-3).

BOX 1-3: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Choe HM et al. analyzed data collected using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and linear regression analysis. A level of P < .05 was set to define statistical significance.

Irons BK et al. analyzed data collected using t-test, chi-square, analysis of variance, and Cox regression models. Two-sided tests were performed with a priori alpha level of 0.05.

Research reports or journal articles are vital to communicate research findings to stakeholders such as patients, providers, payers, and policy makers. A research report or journal article is a detailed document that often includes the following sections: introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRaD).19 It is generally peer-reviewed to ensure scientific discourse and scrutiny (Figure 1-3).

BOX 1-4: KEY FINDINGS AND RESEARCH REPORT

Choe HM et al. found a significant decrease (-2.1%) in glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the intervention group when compared to the decrease in the control group (-0.9%). Significant improvements were also seen in other process of care measures. The other results can be found in the research report.

Irons BK et al. found no difference in glycosylated hemoglobin between the two groups. However, there was higher risk (5.19, 95% CI 2.62–10.26) of achieving clinical goal (A1C <7%) in the study group compared to the control group. The other results can be found in the research report.

EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE

Listen
The goal of clinical research is to provide scientific evidence to improve the health and functioning of people. The healthcare providers, payers, and policy makers are all interested in ensuring the delivery of the highest quality patient care. Quality in healthcare refers to “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.”20 According to the IOM, all stakeholders in healthcare should pursue the following six aims in the delivery of quality healthcare8: 1) safe: avoid harm to patients from the healthcare delivery; 2) effective: deliver care that benefits patients; 3) patient-centered: care that is individualized based on patient preferences and values; 4) timely: ensure timely, needed care and avoid delays; 5) efficient: care that maximizes use of healthcare resources; and 6) equitable: care that does not vary due to personal characteristics—race or ethnicity—and minimizes healthcare disparities at the individual and population level. To achieve these aims, patients and populations should receive healthcare that is based on the best scientific evidence. (Figure 1-4).

The core of evidence-based medicine is to translate scientific evidence to patient care. There are several definitions of EBM. Some have initially emphasized the translational aspect of evidence as a “process of systematically finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for clinical decisions.”21 Others have defined EBM holistically as “integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.”22 The holistic definition is the most widely accepted and practiced as it not only emphasizes scientific evidence but also incorporates expertise of clinician and patient preferences. Clinical expertise includes the knowledge, skills, and experience of practitioners to integrate evidence with patient preferences. Any care that is not patient-centered will have limited value as treatment success is dependent on individualization. This holistic approach lends equal importance to evidence (scientific), expertise (provider), and values (patient) to achieve the desired patient outcomes.

Since scientific evidence is the core of EBM, the following steps of EBM are evidence-centered: 1) asking an appropriate and answerable question, 2) finding evidence, 3) appraising evidence, and 4) applying evidence to practice.22 A simplified example is presented in Figure 1-5.

FIGURE 1-5
Example of Evidence-Based Medicine. (Choe HM, Mitrovich S, Dubay D, et al. Proactive case management of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by a clinical pharmacist: a randomized controlled trial. Am J Manag Care. 2005;11:253–260).

Each step is important to ensure that relevant evidence is obtained and combined with clinical expertise and patient values to deliver EBM. An understanding of the scientific research process and value of research evidence is critical in implementing EBM. If the goal of pharmaceutical practice and policy research is to develop an evidence base for pharmaceuticals, pharmacist services, and pharmacy systems, then the goal of EBM is to use the relevant scientific evidence to provide the highest quality patient care.

The research problem or question is the starting point for research. Similarly, asking appropriate question is the starting point for providing EBM. The components of the question should include: patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO). The relevant evidence is obtained after scouting for the evidence from various sources. The most relevant research is then critically appraised to ensure the validity and applicability of the evidence to patient care. This is often a time consuming and critical process in EBM. Just because research is published in a peer-reviewed journal, it does not mean the research is relevant or applicable to patient care.

The understanding of scientific principles is important to ensure that relevant evidence is valid and applicable. Critical appraisal of the selected research will ensure that research findings are correct (internal validity) and are applicable to the clinician’s patient population (external validity). The best available and valid evidence is applied to provide patient-centered care. Medical decision making is a complex process with critical consequences; therefore, it requires “conscientious use, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”23

IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE

Listen
Although evidence-based practices are effective in improving quality of care, there is often an extensive delay in incorporating EBM into practices. Several factors contribute to this delay in translating research into practice, including internal factors such as time and workflow and external factors such as payments and policies. A recent systematic review classified these implementation factors into external context, organization, professional, and intervention.24 Context refers to external environmental structural and process factors such as healthcare structure, financial incentives, market dynamics, payment, and healthcare policies. Organizational factors include institutional infrastructure, governance, work flow, culture, and institutional policies and procedures. Professionals include providers of healthcare including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and allied healthcare members. Since most healthcare delivery involves inter-profession collaboration, there is often a delay in incorporating evidence-based care due to issues in professional roles, philosophy of care, time, and competencies. Finally, evidence-based interventions that lead to their implementation in routine practice are the ones that promote ease of use, acceptance, and extent of benefit across various settings.

The importance of implementation of EBM as a scientific enquiry has been growing due to critical need to have widespread implementation of evidence-based practices. Implementation science is the “scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.”25 Implementation science requires collaboration and teamwork to incorporate evidence-based interventions into practice. Implementation science helps to change practices and improve the quality of healthcare. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to take an active role in implementation science due to their increasing role in patient care. With the rapid expansion of pharmacy services and increasing inter-profession collaboration of care, there is greater need for pharmacists to get involved and take the lead in implementation science to advance the profession of pharmacy.

SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION

Listen
Scientific contributions are critical for pharmacy education and the profession. The evidence base and scientific innovations immensely contribute to the knowledge base for pharmacist training and advancement of the pharmacy profession in the healthcare system. Pharmacy researchers, practitioners, and educators have an important role to play to generate and translate the evidence to patient care. Pharmacist involvement is needed across the research and practice continuum, from basic research to clinical and translation research to evidence-based practice (Figure 1-6).

Basic and clinical researchers are vital in developing the knowledge base relevant to the pharmacy profession. Scientific breakthroughs in the basic sciences such as biology, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology are critical in the development of applications in biomedical sciences. The research support by the NSF and the NIH have been instrumental in transforming the basic biomedical research landscape in the United States.26 Pharmacists can indirectly or directly contribute to basic sciences as they have a broad understanding of basic and applied sciences relevant to pharmacy practice.

Applied scientists in pharmaceutical sciences such as medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics, and pharmacology are instrumental in developing innovative healthcare products and services. The NIH and the pharmaceutical industry have played an important role in funding the applied biomedical sciences.26 Foundations such as American Cancer Society (ACS) and American Heart Association (AHA) are also making a difference in advancing healthcare research. Pharmaceutical scientists have made immense contributions in developing and applying biomedical knowledge to products and services. Pharmacists have made enormous contributions to applied biomedical sciences and have great potential to influence the future landscape of pharmaceutical sciences. Although advanced training such as graduate degrees or fellowships are recommended to directly participate in applied research areas, pharmacists can make a difference in applied research owing to their broad understanding of basic and clinical sciences.

Clinical research is the pathway to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of products and services. With increasing patient care responsibilities, the pharmacists’ role in clinical research has evolved. The 1975 Millis Commission Report recognized the importance of clinical scientists that are well versed in pharmacotherapy and biomedical research and recommended the development of training programs for clinical scientists.27 National organizations, such as the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) followed up on these recommendations and developed educational and training agenda for clinical scientists.

In 2008, the ACCP Taskforce report on research in the PharmD curriculum detailed research content areas and competencies.28 It required pharmacy students to 1) identify problems and research gaps, 2) design research to test hypotheses within the regulatory and ethical framework, 3) conduct analyses, 4) disseminate research findings, and 5) apply study findings to practice. The latest curriculum standards by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) require pharmacist education and training to incorporate 1) principles of research design and methodology, 2) regulatory and ethical principles of research, 3) methods in data management and statistical analyses, 4) principles of drug literature evaluation, and 5) practice implications of research.29 These content areas not only emphasize the drug literature evaluation component, but also principles of research design. Sound understanding of the scientific basis of evidence creation and provision of patient care is essential for pharmacists to succeed in the highly competitive healthcare arena.

With the recent impetus in clinical and translational research, there is increased interest in training clinical scientists. In the past decade, the NIH has created the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to support clinical and translational research.30 Specifically, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program was initiated as part of NCATS to: 1) develop academic infrastructure for translating biomedical research to treatments, 2) involve community practitioners and industry in translational research, and 3) train the next generation of clinical and translational researchers. Such programs are creating exciting collaborative opportunities across medicine, pharmacy, nursing, public health, and other disciplines. There are 60 academic programs in 30 states funded by the NIH as part of CTSA consortium. Several colleges of pharmacy are part of the CTSA consortium. These programs are helping to create clinical research curriculum, training, and mentorship for pharmacy faculty and practitioners.

Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) have been instrumental in conducting clinical and translational research. PBRN consists of a group of clinicians or practitioners involved in translational research who adopt best practices and conduct clinical research.31 PBRNs started with primary care physicians; it now incorporates discipline-specific networks such as dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and others. These networks can be instrumental in 1) identifying problems in patient care, 2) testing effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings, and 3) evaluating patients who can benefit from treatments. PBRNs are considered the “blue highway” that link basic, clinical, and translational research.32 ACCP PBRN is one of the first clinical PBRN of clinical pharmacists in inpatient and outpatient settings. The research findings from such networks are vital for developing evidence-based practices in pharmacy.

The healthcare industry is a highly competitive marketplace with competing interests from providers, payers, and policy-makers. With the increasing pressure of costs and efficiency, there is a need for providers to demonstrate value for their services based on scientific evidence. Several recent studies demonstrated the value in terms of cost, quality, and outcomes for pharmacists’ services. The Asheville project demonstrated the impact of pharmacist services for asthma on decreased costs and improved quality.33 The Fleetwood project showed the pharmacists’ positive impact on quality and costs in long-term care.34 A study by Chisholm-Burns et al. provided the best evidence for pharmacists’ value in healthcare based on the data from 298 studies.35 The meta-analyses found that pharmacist-directed patient care services have a positive impact on patient outcomes across settings and diseases. Such strong scientific evidence is vital to demonstrate pharmacists’ contributions and to be recognized as healthcare providers. With increasing need for evidence for practice and policy, clinical and translational research and evidence-based practices are imperative for new models of pharmaceutical care.The scientific research process involves the following steps: 1) pose a research question and hypothesis, 2) develop and implement a research plan, 3) perform data collection and analysis, and 4) prepare a research report.6 Each of these steps is critical for scientific inquiry. The research question or hypothesis dictates the research plans and data collection. Often practical and scientific considerations necessitate overlap of these steps of research process.

Choe HM et al. found a significant decrease (-2.1%) in glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the intervention group when compared to the decrease in the control group (-0.9%). Significant improvements were also seen in other process of care measures. The other results can be found in the research report.

Irons BK et al. found no difference in glycosylated hemoglobin between the two groups. However, there was higher risk (5.19, 95% CI 2.62–10.26) of achieving clinical goal (A1C <7%) in the study group compared to the control group. The other results can be found in the research report.

EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE

Listen
The goal of clinical research is to provide scientific evidence to improve the health and functioning of people. The healthcare providers, payers, and policy makers are all interested in ensuring the delivery of the highest quality patient care. Quality in healthcare refers to “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.”20 According to the IOM, all stakeholders in healthcare should pursue the following six aims in the delivery of quality healthcare8: 1) safe: avoid harm to patients from the healthcare delivery; 2) effective: deliver care that benefits patients; 3) patient-centered: care that is individualized based on patient preferences and values; 4) timely: ensure timely, needed care and avoid delays; 5) efficient: care that maximizes use of healthcare resources; and 6) equitable: care that does not vary due to personal characteristics—race or ethnicity—and minimizes healthcare disparities at the individual and population level. To achieve these aims, patients and populations should receive healthcare that is based on the best scientific evidence. (Figure 1-4).

The core of evidence-based medicine is to translate scientific evidence to patient care. There are several definitions of EBM. Some have initially emphasized the translational aspect of evidence as a “process of systematically finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for clinical decisions.”21 Others have defined EBM holistically as “integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.”22 The holistic definition is the most widely accepted and practiced as it not only emphasizes scientific evidence but also incorporates expertise of clinician and patient preferences. Clinical expertise includes the knowledge, skills, and experience of practitioners to integrate evidence with patient preferences. Any care that is not patient-centered will have limited value as treatment success is dependent on individualization. This holistic approach lends equal importance to evidence (scientific), expertise (provider), and values (patient) to achieve the desired patient outcomes.

Since scientific evidence is the core of EBM, the following steps of EBM are evidence-centered: 1) asking an appropriate and answerable question, 2) finding evidence, 3) appraising evidence, and 4) applying evidence to practice.22 A simplified example is presented in Figure 1-5.

Each step is important to ensure that relevant evidence is obtained and combined with clinical expertise and patient values to deliver EBM. An understanding of the scientific research process and value of research evidence is critical in implementing EBM. If the goal of pharmaceutical practice and policy research is to develop an evidence base for pharmaceuticals, pharmacist services, and pharmacy systems, then the goal of EBM is to use the relevant scientific evidence to provide the highest quality patient care.

The research problem or question is the starting point for research. Similarly, asking appropriate question is the starting point for providing EBM. The components of the question should include: patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO). The relevant evidence is obtained after scouting for the evidence from various sources. The most relevant research is then critically appraised to ensure the validity and applicability of the evidence to patient care. This is often a time consuming and critical process in EBM. Just because research is published in a peer-reviewed journal, it does not mean the research is relevant or applicable to patient care.

The understanding of scientific principles is important to ensure that relevant evidence is valid and applicable. Critical appraisal of the selected research will ensure that research findings are correct (internal validity) and are applicable to the clinician’s patient population (external validity). The best available and valid evidence is applied to provide patient-centered care. Medical decision making is a complex process with critical consequences; therefore, it requires “conscientious use, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”23

IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE

Listen
Although evidence-based practices are effective in improving quality of care, there is often an extensive delay in incorporating EBM into practices. Several factors contribute to this delay in translating research into practice, including internal factors such as time and workflow and external factors such as payments and policies. A recent systematic review classified these implementation factors into external context, organization, professional, and intervention.24 Context refers to external environmental structural and process factors such as healthcare structure, financial incentives, market dynamics, payment, and healthcare policies. Organizational factors include institutional infrastructure, governance, work flow, culture, and institutional policies and procedures. Professionals include providers of healthcare including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and allied healthcare members. Since most healthcare delivery involves inter-profession collaboration, there is often a delay in incorporating evidence-based care due to issues in professional roles, philosophy of care, time, and competencies. Finally, evidence-based interventions that lead to their implementation in routine practice are the ones that promote ease of use, acceptance, and extent of benefit across various settings.

The importance of implementation of EBM as a scientific enquiry has been growing due to critical need to have widespread implementation of evidence-based practices. Implementation science is the “scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.”25 Implementation science requires collaboration and teamwork to incorporate evidence-based interventions into practice. Implementation science helps to change practices and improve the quality of healthcare. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to take an active role in implementation science due to their increasing role in patient care. With the rapid expansion of pharmacy services and increasing inter-profession collaboration of care, there is greater need for pharmacists to get involved and take the lead in implementation science to advance the profession of pharmacy.

SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION

Listen
Scientific contributions are critical for pharmacy education and the profession. The evidence base and scientific innovations immensely contribute to the knowledge base for pharmacist training and advancement of the pharmacy profession in the healthcare system. Pharmacy researchers, practitioners, and educators have an important role to play to generate and translate the evidence to patient care. Pharmacist involvement is needed across the research and practice continuum, from basic research to clinical and translation research to evidence-based practice (Figure 1-6).

Basic and clinical researchers are vital in developing the knowledge base relevant to the pharmacy profession. Scientific breakthroughs in the basic sciences such as biology, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology are critical in the development of applications in biomedical sciences. The research support by the NSF and the NIH have been instrumental in transforming the basic biomedical research landscape in the United States.26 Pharmacists can indirectly or directly contribute to basic sciences as they have a broad understanding of basic and applied sciences relevant to pharmacy practice.

Applied scientists in pharmaceutical sciences such as medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics, and pharmacology are instrumental in developing innovative healthcare products and services. The NIH and the pharmaceutical industry have played an important role in funding the applied biomedical sciences.26 Foundations such as American Cancer Society (ACS) and American Heart Association (AHA) are also making a difference in advancing healthcare research. Pharmaceutical scientists have made immense contributions in developing and applying biomedical knowledge to products and services. Pharmacists have made enormous contributions to applied biomedical sciences and have great potential to influence the future landscape of pharmaceutical sciences. Although advanced training such as graduate degrees or fellowships are recommended to directly participate in applied research areas, pharmacists can make a difference in applied research owing to their broad understanding of basic and clinical sciences.

Clinical research is the pathway to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of products and services. With increasing patient care responsibilities, the pharmacists’ role in clinical research has evolved. The 1975 Millis Commission Report recognized the importance of clinical scientists that are well versed in pharmacotherapy and biomedical research and recommended the development of training programs for clinical scientists.27 National organizations, such as the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) followed up on these recommendations and developed educational and training agenda for clinical scientists.

In 2008, the ACCP Taskforce report on research in the PharmD curriculum detailed research content areas and competencies.28 It required pharmacy students to 1) identify problems and research gaps, 2) design research to test hypotheses within the regulatory and ethical framework, 3) conduct analyses, 4) disseminate research findings, and 5) apply study findings to practice. The latest curriculum standards by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) require pharmacist education and training to incorporate 1) principles of research design and methodology, 2) regulatory and ethical principles of research, 3) methods in data management and statistical analyses, 4) principles of drug literature evaluation, and 5) practice implications of research.29 These content areas not only emphasize the drug literature evaluation component, but also principles of research design. Sound understanding of the scientific basis of evidence creation and provision of patient care is essential for pharmacists to succeed in the highly competitive healthcare arena.

With the recent impetus in clinical and translational research, there is increased interest in training clinical scientists. In the past decade, the NIH has created the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to support clinical and translational research.30 Specifically, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program was initiated as part of NCATS to: 1) develop academic infrastructure for translating biomedical research to treatments, 2) involve community practitioners and industry in translational research, and 3) train the next generation of clinical and translational researchers. Such programs are creating exciting collaborative opportunities across medicine, pharmacy, nursing, public health, and other disciplines. There are 60 academic programs in 30 states funded by the NIH as part of CTSA consortium. Several colleges of pharmacy are part of the CTSA consortium. These programs are helping to create clinical research curriculum, training, and mentorship for pharmacy faculty and practitioners.

Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) have been instrumental in conducting clinical and translational research. PBRN consists of a group of clinicians or practitioners involved in translational research who adopt best practices and conduct clinical research.31 PBRNs started with primary care physicians; it now incorporates discipline-specific networks such as dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and others. These networks can be instrumental in 1) identifying problems in patient care, 2) testing effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings, and 3) evaluating patients who can benefit from treatments. PBRNs are considered the “blue highway” that link basic, clinical, and translational research.32 ACCP PBRN is one of the first clinical PBRN of clinical pharmacists in inpatient and outpatient settings. The research findings from such networks are vital for developing evidence-based practices in pharmacy.

The healthcare industry is a highly competitive marketplace with competing interests from providers, payers, and policy-makers. With the increasing pressure of costs and efficiency, there is a need for providers to demonstrate value for their services based on scientific evidence. Several recent studies demonstrated the value in terms of cost, quality, and outcomes for pharmacists’ services. The Asheville project demonstrated the impact of pharmacist services for asthma on decreased costs and improved quality.33 The Fleetwood project showed the pharmacists’ positive impact on quality and costs in long-term care.34 A study by Chisholm-Burns et al. provided the best evidence for pharmacists’ value in healthcare based on the data from 298 studies.35 The meta-analyses found that pharmacist-directed patient care services have a positive impact on patient outcomes across settings and diseases. Such strong scientific evidence is vital to demonstrate pharmacists’ contributions and to be recognized as healthcare providers. With increasing need for evidence for practice and policy, clinical and translational research and evidence-based practices are imperative for new models of pharmaceutical care.
