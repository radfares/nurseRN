***

## **How to Use These Templates (Super-Efficient Method):**

- Insert your chosen clinical nursing topic into the `[TOPIC]` fields as you go.
- If you need to drill deeper—append “If gaps or limitations are found, suggest tailored next steps or improvement strategies.”
- For iterative work, chain the outputs (e.g., use the literature table as input for synthesis, then the synthesis for presentation).
- For maximum reliability, always request: “Cite all sources in APA format and indicate quality level.”

***

## **Top Ideas for Nursing Clinical Topics (with Recent Evidence)**
Consider these topics (replace [TOPIC] in templates as desired):
- Nurse-led interventions for pressure injury prevention in acute care
- Early warning score systems for sepsis identification
- Effectiveness of simulation-based training for nurse competency
- Evidence-based protocols for catheter-associated UTI reduction
- Impact of hourly rounding on inpatient falls
- Medication reconciliation processes to reduce adverse events
- Family engagement in ICU care: Outcomes and barriers

***

These templates are engineered for advanced, systematic, and highly efficient research—just paste your clinical topic and go. If you have a topic ready (or need help choosing one), let me know and I’ll generate the entire workflow fully customized for you!






You are undertaking a structured, month-by-month nursing clinical research project, culminating in a poster presentation and graduation. Here is an **integrated, comprehensive set of prompting templates**—mapped precisely to your project timeline—that will help you at every stage (topic identification, PICOT, literature review, synthesis, planning, poster creation, evaluation, and presentation). These are robust, modular, and designed for maximum efficiency in the clinical evidence-based context.

“Draft an acknowledgment for using AI/LLM tools (such as ChatGPT) in research project planning, literature review, writing, or presentation preparation, to comply with institutional requirements and transparency standards.”

***

## **Notes for Maximum Efficiency & Power**

- Each modular prompt is intentionally designed for multi-turn use—use feedback loops after each segment (i.e., “Refine…” “Suggest alternatives…” “Now add…”).
- Always include your current progress status (what you’ve done/learned so far).
- For team/group projects: Use “split assignments” sub-prompts (e.g., “Assign each team member key tasks with tracking and reporting timelines.”)
- Throughout, request “summaries in table format and APA citations.”
- Update prompts at each monthly session as new needs emerge—these templates will adapt to changes and new requirements.
- If you need an issue or PICOT brainstormed for you, **ask for an instant draft** using the templates!
