Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Objectives: The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate scientific evidence examining the impact of the built environment on patient falls in hospital rooms. Methods: An integrative review (IR) with a systematic literature search was performed using the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome framework. We searched CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMED, and Web of Science databases. The search included peer-reviewed studies from 1990 to 2017 written in English. An additional hand search was also conducted. Selected articles were reviewed and rated based on a hierarchical categorization, comprising six evidence levels, developed by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses and adapted for evidence-based design systematic literature reviews. Results: After a multitiered process, 30 articles met the selection criteria. Thematic areas were created based on the examined elements of the physical environment including patient room configuration and available space, bathroom configuration, bathtub and shower, door, bed height and bed rail, flooring, floor mats, patient chair, lighting, toilet, handrail, grab bars, intravenous pole, sink, ceiling lift, and wheelchair and walking aids. Findings of studies on each element are discussed in detail. Conclusions: Some environmental elements have not been examined in past relational or causal studies, and the level of evidence for the examined attributes is not high enough to gain robust confidence in healthcare design decision-making. Because of the low level of evidence for several environmental elements, conclusions must be taken with caution. More studies using quantitative, relational, or causal designs are recommended to develop actionable interventions on patient falls in hospital rooms.

By:Renshaw, Mark;Tucker, Paula;Norman, KarenIn:British Journal of Nursing, 12/11/2020, volume 29, issue 20, pages 1198-1205 (8p)CINAHL
This article describes a 10-year programme of work that has reduced inpatient falls rate by 46% and how this improvement has been sustained. The methodology applied in this initiative has forced one Trust to challenge expectations about the inevitability of patient falls in hospital. This initiative has resulted in approximately 568 fewer falls each year. Based on costings from NHS Improvement, the estimated 5108 fewer falls between 2011 and 2019 have saved the Trust £13.3 million.

Characteristics of patient falls in hospital.
By:Ostensvik EIn:Nordic Journal of Nursing Research & Clinical Studies / Vård i Norden, 2007, volume 27, issue 3, pages 13-18 (6p)CINAHL
Background: Patient falls are the most reported adverse event in hospitals. Risk factors reported in studies are age, mental status, impaired mobility, toilet needs and environmental factors. Patient falls increase the risk of complications and can lead to potential litigation.Aim: The aim of this paper is to report a study of characteristics of patient falls in a hospital in Norway.Methods: A retrospective study of 295 fall incident reports was performed in a 566-bed hospital in Norway. Information gathered included age, gender, time of day, patient characteristics, activity, environmental factors, and injury. Results: The fall rate was 1.8 per 1000 bed days. Falls at night were significantly higher compared to falls during the day or the evening (p <0.001). Patients (aged 70 and higher) represented 77% of all falls. At the time of falling, 24% of the patients were disoriented, 40% had impaired mobility, and 37% had toilet needs. The most common activity when falling was walking (45%) and falling out of bed (40%). Physical environmental factors were included in 19% of all falls. Serious injury represented 8% of all falls.Conclusion: Patient falls are a multifactoral problem. Analyzing incident reports about falls can highlight the problem and detect patterns and characteristics of patient falls in hospitals.

Managing Patient Falls in Psychiatric Inpatient Units Part 1.
By:Abraham, SamIn:Health Care Manager, Jan-Mar2016, volume 35, issue 1, pages 21-27 (7p)CINAHL
The problem addressed in the current quantitative, descriptive study was the significantly higher number of patient falls in hospital inpatient psychiatric units than in medical-surgical areas, resulting in patient-safety issues. The purpose of this study was to explore psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the factors that contribute to patient falls in the State of Michigan. Two research questions guided the study: (a) What are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible intrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units, and (ft) what are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible extrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units? An online survey was the tool used to gather data from the State of Michigan psychiatric unit directors. The analyses for the 2 questions indicated the participants believed that intrinsic factors were more strongly related to the likelihood of patient falls than were extrinsic factors.

By:Abraham, Samuel PIn:Psychiatric Nursing Directors' Perceptions of the Factors Contributing to Patient Falls in Psychiatric Inpatient Units, 2012, page 188 pCINAHL
The problem addressed in the current quantitative, descriptive study was the significantly higher number of patient falls in hospital inpatient psychiatric units than in medical-surgical areas, resulting in patient safety issues. The purpose of this study was to explore psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the factors that contribute to patient falls in the State of Michigan. Two research questions guided the study: (a) What are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible intrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units, and (b) What are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible extrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units? An online survey was the tool used to gather data from the State of Michigan psychiatric unit directors. The analyses for the two questions indicated the participants believed that intrinsic factors were more strongly related to the likelihood of patient falls than were extrinsic factors. In comparing the results, six of the seven factors with the highest mean levels of agreement were intrinsic factors. In the current study, patient gait (M = 4.65) ranked first, history of falls (M = 4.52) second, and multiple medications (M = 4.50) third as fall risk factors. The need for the involvement of the team members (M = 4.55) in preventing falls was the most highly rated factor among the extrinsic factors. Educating unit team members in assisting with fall prevention is a critical consideration for leaders.

Multilevel factors influencing falls of older patients in hospital: The risk of hospital-induced delirium and the impact of nurse staffing.
By:Kim, Jinhyun;Lee, Eunhee;Lee, SunmiIn:Geriatric Nursing, Jan2025, volume 61, pages 13-19 (7p)CINAHL
• Factors such as advanced age, the administration of multiple medications and treatments, mobility limitations, and hospital-induced delirium were identified as determinants of in-patient falls. • The occurrence of hospital-induced delirium in older patients is identified as the most significant contributor to the elevated risk of falls during their hospital stay. • Adequate nurse staffing emerges as a crucial factor in diminishing the risk of falls in older patients who exhibit predisposing risk factors. This study aimed to explore the individual and organizational factors influencing falls among older inpatients, with a particular focus on the risk posed by hospital-induced delirium and the effect of nurse staffing levels. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a national healthcare database to examine falls in hospitalized older adults, applying a mixed-effect logistic regression model Data from 391,902 patients across 580 hospitals revealed that 1.2 % of older inpatients experienced falls. Influential factors for falls included advanced age, the use of multiple medications and treatments, impaired mobility, and hospital-induced delirium. Nurse staffing levels markedly influenced the reduction of fall risks among older patients. Falls among hospitalized older adults are a frequent consequence of multifaceted risk components, highlighting the need for comprehensive fall prevention strategies and adequate.

Implementing falls prevention patient education in hospitals - older people's views on barriers and enablers.
By:Hill, Anne-Marie;Francis-Coad, J.;Vaz, S.;+4 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 11/09/2024, volume 23, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: World falls guidelines recommend that hospitalised older patients receive individualised falls prevention education, yet no studies have sought older people's feedback on how best to deliver falls prevention education in hospitals. The objective of the study was to explore the perspectives of older people and their caregivers about barriers and enablers to implementation of a tailored hospital falls education program. Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Three focus groups and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted. A purposive sample of older people who had previous hospital admissions and caregivers of older people were selected to review a co-designed patient falls education program (the revised Safe Recovery program). They provided feedback on how to implement the program in hospital settings. Data were thematically analysed taking an deductive-inductive approach. Results: Participants were 37 older people [female n = 24 (64.9%), age range 64 to 89 years] and nine caregivers (female n = 8). The first theme was that the Safe Recovery Program resources were of high quality, enabling strong patient engagement and increased knowledge and awareness about falls prevention in hospitals. The second theme identified practical strategies to enable program delivery in hospital wards. The key enablers identified were: timing of delivery around wellness and the patient's mobility; tailoring messages for each older patient; key staff members being assigned to lead program delivery. Participants recommended that staff assist older patients to set appropriate behavioural goals in relation to preventing falls in hospitals. They also recommended that staff raise older patients' confidence and motivation to take action to reduce the risk of falls. Providing resources in other languages and alternative shorter versions was recommended to enable broad dissemination. Conclusions: Older people and their caregivers advised that implementing falls education in hospitals can be enabled by using high quality resources, delivering falls education in a timely manner and personalising the education and support to individual needs.

Background/Aims Falls are a key patient safety concern because of the associated physical injuries, emotional impact and financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of falls and assess the potential risk factors among hospitalised patients in a medium-sized acute care hospital in Queensland, Australia. Methods This was a retrospective descriptive study using routinely collected information. The study was conducted in a medium-sized public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Characteristics of patients, their fall risk classification and circumstances of patient falls were extracted from the incident report provided by the hospital. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results A total of 677 patient fall incidents were documented on the hospital's electronic incident system from 2015-17. The majority of falls (98%) occurred in inpatient units and caused no or minimal harm to patients. Older age groups (75-84 years and 85-94 years) made up the greatest proportion of patients who fell. Falls were largely related to toileting activities. The most common locations for inpatient falls were the bed, bedside trolley or treatment chair. Conclusions Intervention studies are needed to develop and evaluate procedures to prevent falls, particularly for activities with a high risk of falls, such as toileting, and for older patients.

Objectives: Identify and synthesize published qualitative research reporting inpatient experiences of a fall to determine novel insights and understandings of this longstanding complex problem. Research Design: Qualitative meta‐synthesis. Methods: Online databases were searched to systematically identify published research reporting inpatient experiences of a fall. The included studies were inductively analysed and interpreted then reported as a meta‐synthesis. Data Sources: Databases Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid Emcare, CINAHL Complete, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global were searched on 3rd August, 2023. Results: From 10 included publications, four new themes of inpatients' experiences of a fall were constructed. Themes one, two and three related to antecedents of patient falls, and theme four related to consequences. Theme one, 'My foot didn't come with me: Physiological and anatomical changes', encompassed patients' experiences of medical conditions, medication, and anatomical changes. These aspects contributed to alterations in balance and strength, and misconceptions of capability in activities of daily (inpatient) living. Theme two, 'I was in a hurry: Help‐seeking', encompassed patients' experiences striving for independence while balancing power and control, minimizing their own needs over care of others', and unavailability of support. Theme three, 'I couldn't find the call light: Environment and equipment', encompassed patients' experiences of not being able to reach or use equipment, and environment changes. Theme four, 'It was my fault too: Blame and confidence', encompassed patients' expressions of blame after their fall, blame directed at both themselves and/or others, and impacts on confidence and fear in mobilizing. Conclusions: Inpatient falls are embedded in a complexity of individual, relational, and environmental factors, yet there are potential ways forward both informed and led by the patient's voice. Strength‐based approaches to address the tenuous balance between independence and support may be one opportunity to explore as a next step in complementing the existing multifaceted interventions. Impact: Inpatient falls are a complex and costly health safety and quality problem.Despite global initiatives in the prevention of inpatient falls, they remain intractable.This meta‐synthesis provides an in‐depth exploration of extant qualitative data on patients' experiences of falls in hospitals.Four themes were constructed expressing the inpatients' experiences: physiological and anatomical changes, help‐seeking, environment and equipment, and blame and confidence.Novel considerations for future investigation are offered, drawing from self‐determination theory and positive psychological interventions. Implications for Patient Care: This meta‐synthesis elicits new considerations for future interventions based on people's experiences of their fall in hospital, offering healthcare professionals novel directions in fall prevention. Reporting Method: The review was reported according to the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research statement (ENTREQ; Tong et al., 2012). Patient or Public Contribution: No Patient or Public Contribution. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023445279.

Does delirium prevention reduce risk of in-patient falls among older adults? A systematic review and trial sequential meta-analysis.
By:He, Steven;Rolls, Kaye;Stott, Katrina;+10 moreIn:Australasian Journal on Ageing, Sep2022, volume 41, issue 3, pages 396-406 (11p)CINAHL
Objectives: To determine whether delirium prevention interventions reduce the risk of falls among older hospitalised patients. Methods: A systematic search of health-care databases was undertaken. Given the frequency of small sample sized trials, a trial sequential meta-analysis was conducted to present estimate summary effects to date. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate the posterior probability of the delirium prevention interventions reducing falls risk by various clinically relevant levels. Results: Five randomised controlled trials were included in our final meta-analysis. There was a 43% reduction in the risk of falls among participants in the delirium prevention intervention arm, compared to the control; however, confidence intervals were wide (RE RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.32; 1.00, p = 0.05). This result was found to be statistically significant, according to traditional significance levels (z > 1.96) and the more conservative trial sequential analysis monitoring boundaries. The posterior probabilities of the delirium prevention intervention reducing the risk of falls by 10%, 20% and 30% were 0.86, 0.63 and 0.29 respectively. Conclusions: The results of this systematic review and trial sequential meta-analysis suggest that delirium prevention trials may reduce the risk of in-hospital falls among older patients by 43%. However, despite significant risk reduction found upon meta-analysis, the variation among study populations and intervention components raised questions around its application in clinical practice. Further research is required to investigate what the necessary components of a multifactorial intervention are to reduce both delirium and fall incidence among older adult in-patients.

Tools for Hospital falls prevention with patient education: a scoping review.

Hospital falls prevention with patient education: a scoping review.
By:Heng, Hazel;Jazayeri, Dana;Shaw, Louise;+3 moreIn:BMC Geriatrics, 04/15/2020, volume 20, issue 1, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background: Hospital falls remain a frequent and debilitating problem worldwide. Most hospital falls prevention strategies have targeted clinician education, environmental modifications, assistive devices, hospital systems and medication reviews. The role that patients can play in preventing falls whilst in hospital has received less attention. This critical review scopes patient falls education interventions for hospitals. The quality of the educational designs under-pinning patient falls education programmes was also evaluated. The outcomes of patient-centred falls prevention programs were considered for a range of hospital settings and diagnoses.Methods: The Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework for scoping reviews was adapted using Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases, including grey literature, were searched from January 2008 until February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and data were extracted and summarised thematically. The quality of falls prevention education programs for patients was also appraised using a modified quality metric tool.Results: Forty-three articles were included in the final analysis. The interventions included: (i) direct face-to-face patient education about falls risks and mitigation; (ii) educational tools; (iii) patient-focussed consumer materials such as pamphlets, brochures and handouts; and (iv) hospital systems, policies and procedures to assist patients to prevent falls. The included studies assessed falls or education related outcomes before and after patient falls prevention education. Few studies reported incorporating education design principles or educational theories. When reported, most educational programs were of low to moderate quality from an educational design perspective.Conclusions: There is emerging evidence that hospital falls prevention interventions that incorporate patient education can reduce falls and associated injuries such as bruising, lacerations or fractures. The design, mode of delivery and quality of educational design influence outcomes. Well-designed education programs can improve knowledge and self-perception of risk, empowering patients to reduce their risk of falling whilst in hospital.

Introduction: Intrahospitalary falls are among the national and international priorities in terms of quality of care. Although several intrinsic and extrinsic elements associated with patient falls have been recognized, information and evidence on these elements are lacking in Colombia. Thus, we aimed to characterize the falls of patients and their associated factors in a high-complexity hospital in Bogotá, Colombia between 2013 and 2016. Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study based on the data obtained from the registry of falls that occurred during the study period in a high-complexity hospital in Bogotá, Colombia was carried out. Descriptive statistical analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Of the 951 falls that occurred between 2013 and 2016, 63.1% were classified as adverse events. According to the severity of falls, 54.2% falls were "moderate" and "severe." According to the demographic characteristics, 53.0% patients were men, 65.5% were ≥65 years old (median: 71 years, minimum: 16 years, maximum: 98 years), and 23.2% had circulatory diseases. The following factors were found to be associated with an increased risk for a fall that culminated in an adverse event: being a woman (95% ci = 1.08--1.87), night shift (95% ci; or = 1.09--2.03), and clinical (95% ci = 1.36--4.84) and surgical specialties (95% ci = 1.14--4.46). Conclusion: Patient falls are important adverse events that require intervention in hospital institutions. Intrinsic elements (mainly age) and extrinsic elements (work shift and medical specialty) were identified to cause harm to the patient in the event of a fall.

Tools for Defining Patient Safety Events in Inpatient Psychiatry.

Defining Patient Safety Events in Inpatient Psychiatry.
By:Marcus, Steven C.;Hermann, Richard C.;Cullen, Sara WieselIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Dec2021, volume 17, issue 8, pages e1452-e1457CINAHL
Objectives: The past 20 years have seen the emergence of a national movement to improve hospital-based healthcare safety in the United States. However, much of the foundational work and subsequent research have neglected inpatient psychiatry. The aim of this article was to advance a comprehensive approach for conceptualizing patient safety in inpatient psychiatry as framed by an application of the Institute of Medicine patient safety framework. Methods: This article develops a framework for characterizing patient safety in hospital-based mental health care. We discuss some of the conceptual and methodological issues related to defining what constitutes a patient safety event in inpatient psychiatry and then enumerate a comprehensive set of definitions of the types of safety events that occur in this setting. Results: Patient safety events in inpatient psychiatry are broadly categorized as adverse events and medical errors. Adverse events are composed of adverse drug events and nondrug adverse events, including self-harm or injury to self, assault, sexual contact, patient falls, and other injuries. Medical errors include medication errors and nonmedication errors, such as elopement and contraband. We have developed clear definitions that would be appropriate for use in epidemiological studies of inpatient mental health treatment. Conclusions: Psychiatry has not been an integral part of the national safety movement. As a first step toward breaching this chasm, we have considered how psychiatric events fit into the safety framework adopted across much of medicine. Patient safety should become a key part of inpatient psychiatry's mission and pursued rigorously as the subject of research and intervention efforts.

Patient falls are the most common type of in-hospital accidents. The objective of this retrospective descriptive study was to describe the locations and characteristics of hospital-related falls. Data on patient characteristics, including locations and fall circumstances, were collected through incident reports and medical records. A total of 1822 falls were documented at a 921-bed, urban academic hospital center over a one-year period; 1767 (97.0%) of the falls occurred in the hospital setting, 55 (3.0%) in ambulatory care. The majority of falls (80.8%) occurred within inpatient units; the remainder within the greater hospital campus. In all, 73.4% of fallers had fall prevention protocols implemented prior to the fall. The youngest age group (≤49 years) had the highest percentage of fallers. This study provides novel insights into variables found to be associated with falling, including location of falls within the hospital campus, efficacy of fall prevention protocols, and age groups.

Background: In-hospital patient falls are a persistent problem in health care, resulting in increased length of stay and nonreimbursable charges. Local Problem: Although fall prevention programs have decreased inpatient fall rates, our hospital averages 30 falls per month. Methods: This was a quality improvement project, including a simulation and debriefing. We performed a thematic analysis on the debriefing responses and tracked the inpatient fall rates over 8 months. Interventions: We developed and implemented a low-cost simulation to allow bedside clinicians to experience the physiological changes experienced by patients, which contribute to inpatient falls. Results: Fifty-one clinicians participated in the simulation; each expressed an increased understanding in the physical limitations of patients and shared at least 1 technique to help prevent falls for their patient population. The fall rate was reduced by 23.17% in the succeeding 8 months. Conclusions: Clinicians' awareness of patients' physiological changes can be increased by a low-cost, rapid simulation, resulting in fewer falls.

Tools for Impact of Fall Prevention on Nurses and Care of Fall Risk Patients.

Impact of Fall Prevention on Nurses and Care of Fall Risk Patients.
By:King, Barbara;Pecanac, Kristen;Krupp, Anna;+2 moreIn:Gerontologist, Apr2018, volume 58, issue 2, pages 331-340 (10p)CINAHL
Purpose of the Study: Falls are common events for hospitalized older adults, resulting in negative outcomes both for patients and hospitals. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) has placed pressure on hospital administrators by identifying falls as a "never event", resulting in a zero falls goal for many hospitals. Staff nurses are responsible for providing direct care to patients and for meeting the hospital no falls goal. Little is known about the impact of "zero falls" on nurses, patients and the organization. Design and Methods: A qualitative study, using Grounded Dimensional Analysis (GDA) was conducted to explore nurses' experiences with fall prevention in hospital settings and the impact of those experiences on how nurses provide care to fall risk patients. Twenty-seven registered nurses and certified nursing assistants participated in in-depth interviews. Open, axial and selective coding was used to analyze data. A conceptual model which illustrates the impact of intense messaging from nursing administration to prevent patient falls on nurses, actions nurses take to address the message and the consequences to nurses, older adult patients and to the organization was developed. Results: Intense messaging from hospital administration to achieve zero falls resulted in nurses developing a fear of falls, protecting self and unit, and restricting fall risk patients as a way to stop messages and meet the hospital goal. Implications: Results of this study identify unintended consequences of fall prevention message on nurses and older adult patients. Further research is needed understand how nurse care for fall risk patients.

Tools for Patient safety culture and attitudes among emergency care unit nurses in Türkiye.

Patient safety culture and attitudes among emergency care unit nurses in Türkiye.
By:Aydemir, Azize;Koç, ZelihaIn:Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, Mar2023, volume 29, issue 3, pages 195-204 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Nurses have a key role in ensuring the safety of patients, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving patient outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to determine the factors affecting patient safety, with a focus on the culture and attitudes of nurses working in emergency units. Method: This cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted between 10 January and 30 August 2015 among 282 nurses who worked at emergency units of 19 hospitals in the north-central Black Sea Region of Türkiye Data were obtained using descriptive information forms, the Patient Safety Attitude Scale (PSAS) and the Patient Safety Culture Scale (PSCS). Results: The mean total PSAS score was 152.26 [standard deviation (SD) 22.54; range 46--230], while the mean total PSCS score was 2.56 (SD 0.52; range 1--4). Around a quarter of the participants reported errors, such as medication errors and patient falls, which threatened patient safety in the emergency units. The case report forms were not filled when these errors occurred. Conclusion: Attitude and culture of nurses in hospital emergency units towards patient safety differed according to their sociodemographic and work--life characteristics, including being satisfied with working in the emergency room, quality of work--life balance, level of job satisfaction, and number of years working in the emergency room.

Tools for Is It Possible to Identify Risks for Injurious Falls in Hospitalized Patients?

Is It Possible to Identify Risks for Injurious Falls in Hospitalized Patients?
By:Mion, Lorraine C.;Chandler, A. Michelle;Waters, Teresa M.;+4 moreIn:Joint Commission Journal on Quality & Patient Safety, 2012 Sep, volume 38, issue 9, pages 408-413 (6p)CINAHL
Background: Patient falls are among the most commonly reported adverse hospital events with more than one million occurring annually in the United States; approximately 10% result in serious injury. A retrospective study was conducted to determine predictors and outcomes of fall injuries among a cohort of adult hospitalized patients. Methods: Data were obtained regarding patients who sustained an initial fall in hospital during a 26-month period from 16 adult general medical and surgical units in an urban university-affiliated community hospital. Data on intrinsic (individual) factors, extrinsic (environmental) factors, and situational activities were collected via nurse and patient interviews, patient examinations, and audits of incident reports and electronic health records. Fall injuries were classified as none/any for analyses. Unadjusted odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] for each of the variables of interest with fall injury were generated using logistic regressions. Results: The 784 patients had a median age of 63.5 years (range, 20 to > 90 years), 390 (50%) were women, and 526 (67%) were black. Some 228 (29%) fallers sustained injury; patients who were white (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.62, 3.08), or were administered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.67), two antipsychotic agents (OR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.20, 8.90), an opiate (OR: 1.59; 95%; CI: 1.14, 2.20), or a diuretic non-antihypertensive agent (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.26) were more likely to sustain an injury. Home-based wheelchair use was protective of fall injury (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.84). Seventy-nine percent of the patients had been designated as 'high' fall risk within 24 hours before the fall. Conclusions: Few variables were able to distinguish patients who sustained injury after a hospital fall, further challenging clinicians' efforts to minimize hospital-related fall injury.

Tools for Prevention of in-hospital falls: development of criteria for the conduct of a multi-site audit.

Prevention of in-hospital falls: development of criteria for the conduct of a multi-site audit.
By:Giles, Kristy;Stephenson, Matthew;McArthur, Alexa;+1 moreIn:International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare, Jun2015, volume 13, issue 2, pages 104-111 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Patient falls are a significant issue for hospitals due to the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with these events, as well as the financial costs for the healthcare system. Objectives: To establish what constitutes best practice in terms of fall prevention in acute care facilities and use this to inform the development of best practice audit criteria. Methods: Criteria for clinical audit were developed from evidence derived from systematic reviews and guidelines. While these were drawn from the best available evidence, they were also developed in conjunction with clinicians undertaking a fall-prevention clinical audit and key stakeholders from the clinical settings to ensure their relevance and applicability to the acute care setting. Results: Current literature recommends a comprehensive and multifactorial approach to fall prevention. Eight audit criteria were derived from the best available evidence including the domains of physical environment, hospital culture and care processes, use of technology and targeted interventions. Conclusions: Existing research evidence and consultation with stakeholders has allowed the development of applicable, evidence-based audit criteria for fall prevention in acute care settings. This model can promote engagement, impact clinical practice and lead to improved outcomes.

Tools for Budgetary investment in evidence‐based practice by chief nurses and stronger EBP cultures are associated with less turnover and better patient outcomes.

Budgetary investment in evidence‐based practice by chief nurses and stronger EBP cultures are associated with less turnover and better patient outcomes.
By:Melnyk, Bernadette Mazurek;Hsieh, Andreanna Pavan;Messinger, Jeffery;+3 moreIn:Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Apr2023, volume 20, issue 2, pages 162-171 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Hospitals and healthcare systems strive to meet benchmarks for the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicator (NDNQI) measures, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Core Measures, and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) outcome indicators. Prior research indicates that Chief Nursing Officers and Executives (CNOs, CNEs) believe that evidence‐based practice (EBP) is important for ensuring the quality of care, but they allocate little funding to its implementation and report it as a low priority in their healthcare system. It is not known how EBP budget investment by chief nurses affects NDNQI, CMS Core Measures, and HCAHPS indicators or key EBP attributes and nurse outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to generate evidence on the relationships among the budget devoted to EBP by chief nurses and its impact on key patient and nurse outcomes along with EBP attributes. Methods: A descriptive correlational design was used. An online survey was sent to CNO and CNE members (N = 5026) of various national and regional nurse leader professional organizations across the United States in two recruitment rounds. Data collected included CNO/CNE EBP Beliefs, EBP Implementation, and perceived organizational culture of EBP; organizational culture, structure, personnel, and resources for EBP; percent of budget dedicated to EBP; key performance measures (NDNQI, CMS Core Measures, HCAHPS); nurse satisfaction; nurse turnover; and demographic questions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics. Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients were calculated among EBP budget, nursing outcome measures, and EBP measures. Results: One hundred and fifteen CNEs/CNOs completed the survey (a 2.3% response rate). The majority (60.9%) allocated <5% of their budget to EBP, with a third investing none. An increase in EBP budget was associated with fewer patient falls and trauma, less nursing turnover, and stronger EBP culture and other positive EBP attributes. A greater number of EBP projects were also associated with better patient outcomes. Linking Evidence to Action: Chief nurse executives and CNOs allocate very little of their budgets to EBP. When CNEs and CNOs invest more in EBP, patient, nursing, and EBP outcomes improve. System‐wide implementation of EBP, which includes appropriate EBP budget allocation, is necessary for improvements in hospital quality indicators and nursing turnover.

Tools for Purposeful Hourly Rounding to Decrease Peripheral Intravenous Infiltrations and Extravasations in Pediatrics.

Purposeful Hourly Rounding to Decrease Peripheral Intravenous Infiltrations and Extravasations in Pediatrics.
By:Garcia, Mayra G.;Dutton, Hayden;Samuel, Kiele;+1 moreIn:Journal of Pediatric Nursing, Nov2021, volume 61, pages 59-66 (8p)CINAHL
Pediatric patients are at high risk for peripheral intravenous infiltrations and extravasations (PIVIE) resulting in patient harm. Structured hourly rounding has demonstrated to improve quality outcomes. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to implement structured hourly rounding to decrease the median rate of moderate PIVIE rates from 3.13 to 2.58 per thousand patient days over a 6-month time period in pediatric patients with infusing continuous IV fluids. A pilot was conducted to hardwire hourly assessments for peripheral intravenous lines (PIV) in pediatric patients with continuous fluids utilizing a structured hourly rounding process. Bedside nurses utilized the P.A.T.H. model to assess pain management (P), assess PIVs for early PIVIE recognition (A), address things patient and family may need (T), and reduce the occurrence in hospital acquired conditions (H). Data was collected on unit nurse sensitive indicators and compliance to hourly rounding. Structured hourly rounding using the P.A.T.H. model successfully hardwired hourly PIV assessments. The unit reduced their median moderate PIVIE rate to 1.83 per thousand patient days, an 41% improvement. The pilot also had positive unintended consequences of improved pain reassessment from 67% to 100%, increased patient satisfaction scores of 67% to 97% and reduced patient falls by 29%. Structured hourly rounding using the P.A.T.H. model can positively hardwire hourly PIV assessments in pediatric patients. Sustainability of hourly rounding requires leadership support and nursing commitment to impact quality metrics. Organizations should consider implementing focused hourly rounding to address PIVIEs.

The identification and characterization of nurse-sensitive outcomes in acute and critical care: A systematic review.
By:McEvoy, Natalie L.;Kalvas, Laura Beth;Walsh, Killian;+1 moreIn:Nursing Outlook, Mar2025, volume 73, issue 2, page N.PAGCINAHL
Few nurse-sensitive patient and family outcome measures are included in hospital core metrics used for accreditation, credentialing, or recognition. Identify and characterize patient and family outcome measures that are sensitive to the work of acute and critical nursing. Systematic literature review that included all age groups and excluded measures commonly reported for hospital accreditation, credentialing, or recognition (i.e., patient falls, pressure injuries/pressure ulcers, and hospital-acquired infections). In total, 16 studies met review criteria. Eight (50%) studies were conducted in acute care, five (31.3%) in critical care, and three (18.8%) in surgical settings. Eight (50%) were conducted in adults, four (25%) in pediatrics, and one (6.3%) in neonates. Three (18.8%) studies did not specify the population of interest. Overall, 55 nurse-sensitive outcomes were identified and 47 (85.5%) were operationally defined. These included patient/family satisfaction (n = 7, 12.7%), patient complications (n = 6, 10.9%), ventilator-related outcomes (n = 6, 10.9%), unplanned extubation (n = 5, 9.1%), and symptom-related outcomes (n = 6, 10.9%). Outcomes differed by patient population and setting. It is important to broaden nurse-sensitive outcome measurement in acute/critical care settings to recognize the full spectrum of nursing's work in hospitals. When core hospital outcome measures reflect the true work of nursing, its value to patients, families, and organizations can be made visible. • Current nurse-sensitive outcomes (NSOs) in acute/critical care are inadequate. • Funding agency support and regulatory body endorsement of new NSOs are needed. • Nursing's value can be made visible by NSOs that fully reflect its work.

Tools for Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for risk of in-hospital falls using physiotherapist clinical judgement.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for risk of in-hospital falls using physiotherapist clinical judgement.
By:Haines T;Kuys SS;Morrison G;+2 moreIn:Medical Care, 2009 Apr, volume 47, issue 4, pages 448-456 (9p)CINAHL
INTRODUCTION: Screening hospital patients for falls risk is now a contentious component of geriatric care despite its widespread clinical use. The economic implications of using a falls risk screening approach to deliver an effective falls prevention intervention have not previously been examined. METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective longitudinal cohort and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One thousand one hundred twenty-three geriatric inpatients from 17 rehabilitation units across Australia. MEASURES: Physiotherapist accuracy in predicting patient who will fall was captured with the question 'Will this patient experience one or more falls during their rehabilitation period?' Falls were measured using hospital incident reporting systems. PROCEDURE: The multicenter longitudinal cohort was undertaken to establish the predictive accuracy of physiotherapist clinical judgement. This data was used in the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis where estimates of the cost of falls and effectiveness of an intervention program were taken from previous research. RESULTS: The accuracy of physiotherapist clinical judgement in predicting falls was high relative to previous research (sensitivity = 0.61, specificity = 0.82, Youden index = 0.43). Selectively providing patient falls-prevention education using physiotherapist clinical judgement would reduce falls [2.2 (SD: 0.19) fallers per 100 inpatients reduction] and reduce resources spent on trying to prevent and treat injuries from in-hospital falls [$2704 AUD (SD: $432) per 100 inpatients reduction] compared with doing nothing. However, there was greater uncertainty as to whether the patient education intervention modeled should be provided selectively or universally. CONCLUSIONS: Preventing in-hospital falls using a targeted falls prevention intervention approach utilizing physiotherapist clinical judgement was more cost-effective than a 'no intervention' approach.

Aim. This paper is a report of a study to evaluate the validity of three fall-risk assessment tools to identify patients at high risk for falls. Background. Patient falls make up 38% of all adverse events occurring in hospital settings, and may result in physical injury and undesirable emotional and financial outcomes. No single fall-risk assessment tool has been conclusively validated. Method. The Morse Fall Scale, St Thomas Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients, and Hendrich II Fall Risk Model were validated in inter-rater reliability and validity studies in 2003. This included assessment of the probability of disagreement, kappa-values, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values of the assessment tools with the associated 95% CI. Findings. One hundred and forty-four patients were recruited for the inter-rater reliability study. The probabilities of disagreement were between 2.8% and 9.7%, and 95% CI for all tools ranged from 1.1% to 15.7%. The j-values were all higher than 0.80. In the validity study, 5489 patients were recruited to observe 60 falls. The Morse Fall Scale at a cutoff score of 25 and Heindrich II Fall Risk Model at a cutoff score of 5 had strong sensitivity values of 88% and 70%, respectively. However, in comparison with the Morse Fall Scale (specificity = 48.3%), only the Heindrich II Fall Risk Model had a more acceptable level of specificity (61.5%). Conclusion. The Heindrich II Fall Risk Model is potentially useful in identifying patients at high risk for falls in acute care facilities.

Tools for The Impact of Engagement Strategies on the Reduction of Patient Falls.

The Impact of Engagement Strategies on the Reduction of Patient Falls.
By:Martin, Rosemary ButlerIn:Impact of Engagement Strategies on the Reduction of Patient Falls, 2017, page 1 (1p)CINAHL
Despite the availability of many fall prevention measures, many patients fall in U.S. hospitals each year. Experts view patient fall rates as the measure that can be most affected by a nurse-led, evidence-based intervention. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to implement and evaluate the impact of patient engagement strategies on patient compliance to fall prevention education and the reduction of falls. The quality improvement framework used for this project was the Iowa Model. Interventions for this project included patient engagement strategies including the teach-back (TB) method and video-based fall prevention education paired with the project site's existing fall prevention program. A prospective quantitative design was used to answer the practice-focused question of whether the implementation of a falls protocol incorporating patient engagement strategies improves patient compliance with the fall prevention plan of care and reduces patient falls. A total of 58 patients were included in this project, conducted from July to October 2017. The results showed a 75% reduction in the fall rate compared to the same three month period in 2016. This finding suggests that reinforcement of oral and written instruction through video education follow-up and the use of the TB method to assess patient understanding are effective measures to reduce patient falls and increase patient compliance to the fall prevention plan of care. These patient engagement strategies can be replicated by nurses in similar acute care settings. Adoption of such evidence-based changes in nursing practice may improve patient safety and decrease harm in hospital settings as implications for positive social change.

Tools for In-hospital patient falls after total joint arthroplasty: incidence, demographics, and risk factors in the United States.

In-hospital patient falls after total joint arthroplasty: incidence, demographics, and risk factors in the United States.
By:Memtsoudis SG;Dy CJ;Ma Y;+9 moreIn:Journal of Arthroplasty, Jun2012, volume 27, issue 6, pages 823-828.e1 (7458p)CINAHL
In-hospital falls (IFs) increase morbidity, cost, and may result in litigation. We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to quantify the incidence of IFs in patients who underwent hip and knee arthroplasty and to define trends, patient's demographics, risk factors, complications, and hospital cost. Patients operated on between 1998 and 2007 were identified and grouped depending on the presence of a diagnosis of IF. Of those, 0.85% had an IF, representing 2.1 falls per 1000 inpatient days. The incidence of IF increased from 0.4% to 1.3% during the study period. Independent risk factors included revision surgery, advanced age, male sex, minority race, and the presence of comorbidities. Patients having IF had a longer hospital stay and were less likely to be discharged to their primary residence. In-hospital mortality, complications, and cost were higher in patients sustaining IF. Given the associated morbidity, mortality, and increased cost, resources should be allocated to minimize the risk of IF in this population.

Tools for Do Magnet®-accredited hospitals show improvements in nurse and patient outcomes compared to non-Magnet hospitals: a systematic review protocol.

Do Magnet®-accredited hospitals show improvements in nurse and patient outcomes compared to non-Magnet hospitals: a systematic review protocol.
By:Dariel, Odessa Petit dit;Regnaux, Jean-PhilippeIn:JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports, 2013, volume 11, issue 11, pages 125-140 (16p)CINAHL
In any workplace environment a certain percentage of staff turnover is considered “normal” and even expected1,and thus lies beyond the control of any organizational strategy. Yet if turnover reaches 50% it is potentially a response to a negative work environment and can have a net effect on productivity.2 Considering that nurses provide the vast majority of patient care in hospital settings, high nurse turnover can quickly contribute to even greater organizational dysfunction, interfering with the optimal running of services and having a negative impact on the quality of patient care.3-7 The average nurse turnover rate in the USA has been estimated at 15% to 36% with economic costs estimated at four to five times higher than what is reported due to the underreporting of indirect costs.8 High rates of staff turnover have negative organizational consequences in terms of replacement, recruitment and training costs.6 More importantly turnover has an effect on productivity and the continuity and quality of care.9 Consequently nursing turnover represents a substantial cost to hospitals.10-12 These costs are related to hiring and retraining, use of temporary staffing agencies and staff overtime.1,4,13,14 Turnover has been perceived as a powerful indicator of perceived job satisfaction and the quality of the work environment in a hospital.15 Certain organizational strategies, many of which are addressed in the Magnet® Recognition Program, have been shown to contribute positively to the working environment and increase staff job satisfaction. These include the development of a culture of safety and quality care, staff recognition programs, interdisciplinary communication and horizontal management. These internal forces tend to create a positive work environment that acts as a strong pull for staff to stay, thus countering external forces to leave (e.g. better job opportunities elsewhere).3,16,17 Magnet® hospitals The concept of the Magnet® hospital was developed in the 1980s in the USA and is operated today by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC).16 It was conceived around the characteristics of 41 exemplary hospitals that were identified because they were able to attract and retain staff during periods of nursing shortages. Research was conducted to identify the human resource practices and associated organizational strategies in place to “examine characteristics of systems impeding and/or facilitating professional nursing practice in hospitals”.16 The term “magnet” was used to highlight the attraction professionals felt towards these hospitals with low nurse vacancy and turnover rates, and the characteristics were coined Forces of Magnetism. According to the ANCC, the Magnet® Recognition Program is a tool that pushes hospitals to improve the working environment of nurses so as to have a subsequent positive impact on patient care.18 Today there are approximately 390 hospitals that have achieved Magnet® status, or 7% of general hospitals in the USA.19 Research on Magnet® hospitals has pointed to the positive relationships between the accreditation model and nursing and patient outcomes. Results from these studies have demonstrated that Magnet® hospitals have lower mortality rates20, rates of readmission21 and patient falls.2,23 Furthermore, a 2009 comprehensive JBI systematic review found evidence to support the positive effects of Magnet® accreditation on the work environment, leading to lower rates of burnout and intent to leave and higher staff satisfaction. Little data was found however linking this positive work environment with patient outcomes, nor the economic cost-benefit implications of a Magnet® investment.24 A number of recent studies continue to sustain the notion that Magnet® hospitals outperform average American hospitals, with lower reported turnover and vacancy rates and higher job satisfaction levels.9, 22,25 Yet findings from other research has highlighted inconsistencies with these reports. For example, a 2010 study found little difference between Magnet® and non-Magnet® institutions in terms of working conditions,26 whereas another study found that Magnet® hospitals had significantly worse patient outcomes (infection rates, postoperative sepsis and postoperative derangement) than non- Magnet® hospitals.18 Rationale for undertaking this review Whilst Magnet's® organizational model has been proposed as influential on the work environment and on patient outcomes, these outcomes remain inconclusive.19 There are conflicting findings derived from a wide range of designs, thus influencing the quality of these results. The inconclusive findings call for a systematic review to examine the quantitative evidence on the impact of Magnet® accreditation on nurse and patient outcomes. Decision-makers need such clear data to make decisions regarding whether or not to invest in programs such as Magnet® accreditation, ultimately aimed at improving the quality of care. Outcomes measures To identify improvements in nurse and patient outcomes resulting from Magnet® accreditation it is important to examine some of the common outcomes identified in the literature, their definitions and measurement tools: Staff turnover In this review we define “turnover” as occurring when a nurse leaves an organization rather than the nursing position, profession or career.28,29 The turnover rate is the one at which staff are leaving an organization as a proportion of the total staff employed during a reference period (such as 12 months). The indicator is calculated as: (# of staff who vacated their positions / # of staff employed by the organization or program) x 100. A less objective but more frequently used measure of staff turnover is “intent to leave”. Indeed, Hinshaw and Atwood's30, Alexander et al's31 and Parasuraman32 have proposed that intention to leave is the most immediate determinant of actual turnover. One scale, the Anticipated Turnover Scale (ATS), was recently assessed in a meta-analysis and found to have good reliability and construct validity across studies of Registered Nurses in the USA.33 The Revised Nursing Work Index (NWI-R)35 is also frequently used to measure nurses' intent to leave and job satisfaction as predictors of nurse turnover.34 It has been argued that further work is needed to determine its actual predictive capability.36 The Maslach Burnout Inventory37 is another scale traditionally used to examine the relationship between job satisfaction, burnout and intent to leave amongst nursing staff, as a predictor of nurse turnover. Patient outcomes Nursing-sensitive measures are defined as processes and outcomes that are affected, provided and/or influenced by nursing personnel, but for which nursing is not exclusively responsible.39,41 Nursing-sensitive patient outcome indicators can be identified using the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) and the National Quality Forum (NQF). Two important nursing-sensitive patient outcome indicators are patient falls (Patient Fall Rate: NQF#0141; Falls with injury: NQF#0202) and HAPU (Pressure ulcer prevalence, hospital acquired: NQF#0201) because they are seen to be influenced, if not preventable, by quality nursing care. A patient fall is defined by the NDNQI as an unplanned descent to the floor, with or without injury to the patient that can cause injury and complicate and extend care. Falls are a leading driver of health care costs, especially for the elderly.43,44 A HAPU is defined as the secondary diagnosis of a decubitus ulcer as specified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes 707.00 to 707.09, evaluated as either Stages III or IV. Hospital Acquired Pressure Ulcers are considered among the eight preventable conditions identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that incur significant costs.43 In summary, nurse outcomes such as turnover are important because of the high cost of replacing nurses, the resulting decrease in productivity and the inevitable effect this has on patient care.45 A report published by the Institute of Medicine has acknowledged that nursing is a critical factor in determining the quality of care in hospitals.41 Yet this contribution still must be established empirically. This is increasingly important as nursing-sensitive indicators represent only a small portion of the pool of quality indicators included in public reporting initiatives. The current health care climate requires accountability for the health care policy and managerial decisions made and the impact of these decisions on patient care. The impact of organizational strategies such as Magnet® accreditation claiming to impact both staff and patient outcomes must be more clearly established. A review of the JBI, Cochrane and DARE databases was undertaken to ensure the topic had not been previously explored. Whilst a comprehensive systematic review was published by the JBI in 2009 exploring the impact of Magnet® designation (both for Magnet® and Magnet-aspiring® hospitals) on nursing and patient outcomes, this current proposal intends to specifically explore only quantitative evidence demonstrating the impact of Magnet® accreditation on nursing and patient outcomes. Unlike the earlier review this proposal will include only currently accredited hospitals (excluding Magnet® aspiring hospitals) and will consider primarily Controlled Before and After (CBA) and Interrupted Time Series (ITS). If these are unavailable, then case-controlled, descriptive comparative and descriptive correlational designs will be included. Studies presenting a “case study” with no comparison with another non-Magnet® hospital and other studies reporting on interviews and other qualitative data will be excluded. It is anticipated that more rigorous inclusion criteria will increase the validity of the conclusions that can be made regarding the effect of Magnet® accreditation on both nurse and patient outcomes. Moreover this systematic review will search the literature from 1994 to 2013, thus including a number of studies that have been published since 2008.

Tools for Fall prevention in acute hospital care. A literature review.

Fall prevention in acute hospital care. A literature review.
By:Schwendimann RIn:Pflege, 2000 Jun, volume 13, issue 3, pages 169-179 (11p)CINAHL
Patient falls frequently occur in institutions of health care. Various occurrencies may cause patient falls; and sometimes have grave consequences for the people involved, affecting their quality of life. Falls often result in longer stays in hospital and/or in rehabilitation institutions. Hence patient security and prevention of falls become a quality factor for the health care professionals. The literature search on the subject of fall prevention in acute care from a nursing perspective encompasses the years 1988-1998 (MEDLINE, EMBASE). 21 articles were thoroughly examined. The prevention strategies are essentially based on risk assessment (guess of fall danger), intervention (preventive care measures) systematic reporting of the incidents of falls and their consequences. Introduction of the preventing programs and measures resulted in a considerable reduction of patient falls. The preventive measures focussed on reducing the risks of falling in everyday clinical life by increasing attention and presence of the staff caring for patients. The methods used were descriptive or exploratory. Despite plausible reports, connections between preventive measures and a reduced number of patient falls were not scientifically proven. Further investigations to the effectiveness of caring measures concerning fall prevention in acute care of experimental or quasi-experimental design are needed.

Tools for The Impact of Practice Environment and Nursing Workload on Patient Outcomes among Non-Magnet Hospitals in Saudi Arabia.

The Impact of Practice Environment and Nursing Workload on Patient Outcomes among Non-Magnet Hospitals in Saudi Arabia.
By:Alghamdi, Moahmmed G.In:Impact of Practice Environment & Nursing Workload on Patient Outcomes among Non-Magnet Hospitals in Saudi Arabia, 2017, page 1 (1p)CINAHL
Aim. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of nursing practice environment and perceived nursing workload on 4 dependent variables of patient outcomes including patient satisfaction, patient falls, pressure ulcers, and in-hospital mortality.Design. A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design was utilized with self-administered questionnaires and secondary data analysis.Method. A convenient sample of 355 full-time registered nurses (88.7% response rate) was recruited from 4 governmental hospitals in Saudi Arabia to complete anonymous surveys that measured their perception of practice environment and nursing workload. The PES-NWI was used to measure nursing practice environment and the IWPS-R was used to capture the perceived nursing workload. The 4 patient outcomes were retrieved from electronic patient records during a 6-month period from June 2016 to November 2016.Findings. The results showed significant negative correlations between nursing practice environment and the patient outcomes of patient falls and mortality rate. Patient satisfaction and pressure ulcers did not show any significant correlation with nursing practice environment. The second independent variable of nursing workload showed a significant negative correlation with the patient outcomes of pressure ulcers and mortality rate. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis that nurses' demographic variables, nursing practice environment, and nursing workload explained 16% of the variation in patient satisfaction, 20% in patient falls, 14% in pressure ulcers, and 18% in mortality rate.Conclusion. The evaluation of the associations between the variables of interest supported the conceptual model that were guided by Donabedian's model of healthcare quality, which emphasized the importance of the professional practice environment and nursing workload on patient outcomes.

Tools for Nursing activities, nurse staffing and adverse patient outcomes as perceived by hospital nurses.

Nursing activities, nurse staffing and adverse patient outcomes as perceived by hospital nurses.
By:Hinno, Saima;Partanen, Pirjo;Vehviläinen-Julkunen, KatriIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Jun2012, volume 21, issue 11-12, pages 1584-1593 (10p)CINAHL
Aim. To investigate the relationships between nursing activities, nurse staffing and adverse patient outcomes in hospital settings as perceived by registered nurses in Finland and the Netherlands and to compare the results obtained in the two countries. Background. Previous research indicates that a higher proportion of registered nurses in the staff mix results in better patient outcomes. Knowledge of the relationship between nurse staffing and adverse patient outcomes is crucial to optimise the management of professional nursing resources and patient care. Design. A cross-sectional, descriptive questionnaire survey. Methods. Registered nurses employed in hospitals in Finland ( n = 535) and the Netherlands ( n = 334), with overall response rates of 44·9% and 33·4%, respectively, participated. Results. The patient-to-nurse ratio was on average 8·74:1 and did not vary significantly between the countries. However, there were fewer registered nurses and significantly more licensed practical nurses among the Dutch hospital staff than the Finnish staff. In addition, Finnish nurses performed non-nursing and administrative activities more frequently than the Dutch nurses and reported more dissatisfaction with the availability of support services. Frequencies of patient falls were related to the patient-to-nurse ratio in both countries. Finnish participants reported the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes more frequently. Conclusions. Significant associations were found between nurse staffing and adverse patient outcomes in hospital settings. Compared with the Netherlands, in Finland, nurses appear to have higher workloads, there are higher patient-to-nurse ratios, and these adverse staffing conditions are associated with higher rates of adverse patient outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential effects of major changes or reductions in nursing staff on the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes in hospital settings.

Tools for Improving patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction through nurse-to-nurse communication.

Improving patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction through nurse-to-nurse communication.
By:Pineda, Rica OcampoIn:Improving Patient Outcomes & Nurse Satisfaction Through Nurse-to-nurse Communication, 2015, page 176 pCINAHL
Communication between nurses is vital in ensuring that patient outcomes are achieved. Nurses must effectively transmit information to assure effective and high quality patient-centered care. Patient falls and adverse events have shown an increase in hospital settings. Inaccurate communication and inconsistencies in transmitting patient information have provided the need to revise and redevelop a standardized form for handoff between nurses. The purpose of this evidence-based practice improvement project was to design, implement, and evaluate a nurse-to-nurse communication approach using Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation (SBAR) to enhance safety and quality of patient care. The implementation of an electronic standardized SBAR handoff report between nurses was initiated as part of a pilot project. The goal was to determine if SBAR would support patient safety and a reduction in patient falls. Findings suggest that accuracy at the time of report may influence a decline in the incidences of patient falls and patient safety issues; improving patient outcomes.

Tools for Evidence-Based and Value-Based Decision Making About Healthcare Design.

Evidence-Based and Value-Based Decision Making About Healthcare Design.
By:Zadeh, Rana;Sadatsafavi, Hessam;Xue, RyanIn:Health Environments Research & Design Journal (HERD) (Sage Publications, Ltd.), Jul2015, volume 8, issue 4, pages 58-76 (19p)CINAHL
Objective: This study describes a vision and framework that can facilitate the implementation of evidence-based design (EBD), scientific knowledge base into the process of the design, construction, and operation of healthcare facilities and clarify the related safety and quality outcomes for the stakeholders. The proposed framework pairs EBD with value-driven decision making and aims to improve communication among stakeholders by providing a common analytical language. Background: Recent EBD research indicates that the design and operation of healthcare facilities contribute to an organization’s operational success by improving safety, quality, and efficiency. However, because little information is available about the financial returns of evidence-based investments, such investments are readily eliminated during the capital-investment decision-making process. Method: To model the proposed framework, we used engineering economy tools to evaluate the return on investments in six successful cases, identified by a literature review, in which facility design and operation interventions resulted in reductions in hospital-acquired infections, patient falls, staff injuries, and patient anxiety. Results: In the evidence-based cases, calculated net present values, internal rates of return, and payback periods indicated that the long-term benefits of interventions substantially outweighed the intervention costs. This article explained a framework to develop a research-based and value-based communication language on specific interventions along the planning, design and construction, operation, and evaluation stages. Conclusions: Evidence-based and value-based design frameworks can be applied to communicate the life-cycle costs and savings of EBD interventions to stakeholders, thereby contributing to more informed decision makings and the optimization of healthcare infrastructures.

Tools for Working while sick: validation of the multidimensional presenteeism exposures and productivity survey for nurses (MPEPS-N).

Working while sick: validation of the multidimensional presenteeism exposures and productivity survey for nurses (MPEPS-N).
By:Lui, Juliana Nga Man;Johnston, Janice MaryIn:BMC Health Services Research, 02/08/2019, volume 19, issue 1, page N.PAGCINAHL
Background: Presenteeism is the employee behaviour of physically attending work with reduced performance due to illness or for other reasons. Nurses are four times more likely to exhibit presenteeism compared to other occupations, threatening patient safety through increased patient falls, medication errors and staff-to-patient disease transmission. There is a paucity of standardized instruments that quantify the association between presenteeism with its exposures and related productivity. This study aims to validate an instrument that comprehensively measures presenteeism workplace and personal exposures specifically for Asian nurses.Methods: Questionnaire domain items were selected based on the JD-R framework and a previously conducted systematic review of pre-existing validated scales measuring work attendance exposures used in previous healthcare studies. The preliminary questionnaire consisted of two outcomes (presenteeism frequency, productivity) and five exposure domains: work resources, work demands, work stress, work engagement, personal traits and health. Content validation and back translation (English-Cantonese Chinese-English) were carried out. Responses from full-time nurses working in two acute care hospitals (Preliminary questionnaire at Hospital 1: N = 295 and main round questionnaire at Hospital 2: N = 1146) were included in the validation study to ensure an adequate sample size of ten cases per indicator variable for CFA analysis. A random sample of 80 nurses from Hospital 1 were selected for test-retest reliability 4 weeks post the initial survey. Internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity tests were also tested.Results: Satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7), test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.4); and construct validity - convergent and discriminant validity was achieved. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded satisfactory fitness indices (CFI and TLI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.08). Presenteeism and productivity significantly associated with all work resources, work engagement and work stress constructs in Hospital 2.Conclusion: A reliable Multidimensional Presenteeism Exposures and Productivity Survey (MPEPS-N) has been validated in two distinct hospital environments. The instrument helps to identify and quantify organizational or individual exposures that significantly associate with presenteeism and its related productivity, thus allowing hospital managers to set evidence-based intervention targets for wellness programs and formulate human resource policies in reducing presenteeism-related productivity loss.

Tools for 223 The Use of the IPASS Handoff Communication Tool to Increase Nursing Satisfaction during Handoff on a Burn and Pediatric Unit.

223 The Use of the IPASS Handoff Communication Tool to Increase Nursing Satisfaction during Handoff on a Burn and Pediatric Unit.
In:Journal of Burn Care & Research, 2019 Supplement, volume 40, pages S91-S92CINAHL
Introduction: Multiple studies have established that the nursing handoff process is error-prone and disorganized. IPASS is a standardized handoff tool that has been proven to reduce medical errors but has limited validation in nursing. The objective of this process improvement, nurse-driven, pilot project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IPASS standardized handoff system for nursing satisfaction/communication and patient outcomes on a burn and pediatric acute care unit within a regional referral hospital. Methods: The IPASS handoff tool was adapted and tailored for the unit and hospital's standards. Specific modifications included the addition of burn and pediatric items, safety checks, and patient/nurse interaction. The intervention was then rolled-out to all nursing staff on the unit. A pre and post-intervention survey was administered to staff nurses to assess the satisfaction and perceived quality of shift change handoff. Questions utilized a 5-point Likert scale; descriptive statistics were used for analysis. In-hospital patient clinical outcomes were tracked 6 months pre and post-project roll-out. Results: The project occurred over a two-year period between 2016–2018. Survey respondent characteristics are listed in the table below. Nurses reported a significant increase in satisfaction of shift change report after IPASS roll-out. Nurses reported an increase in the accuracy and understanding of the information received. A decrease in the amount of "gossip or venting" during report was also noted. The number of patient falls decreased by 13% during this review period. The percentage of ICU transfers after a rapid response alert for clinical deterioration decreased from 7% to 5%. No changes were found in infection rate, and length of hospitalization (LOS) increased slightly. Conclusions: IPASS utilization was shown to significantly increase nurse satisfaction and improve overall communication. This project is being considered for hospital-wide implementation as the standardized method of handoff for nurses. Applicability of Research to Practice: A standardized handoff tool can aid in increased nursing satisfaction and communication during the handoff process.

Tools for Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.

Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.
By:Gaguski, Michele E.In:Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing, Oct2025, volume 27, issue 5, pages E241-E247CINAHL
Although patient falls in the acute care setting have been thoroughly studied, published studies exploring falls for patients receiving hospice care remain limited. Patients receiving hospice care present with considerable risk factors for falls, including physical and cognitive changes associated with a terminal diagnosis. An increasing pattern of patient fall rates was identified at the organization and a quality initiative was developed to address this aspect of patient care. The SMART aim of this project was to establish a sustainable process to decrease the percentage of patient falls from 5% to 3% in an organization's hospice regional branch within a 3-month period. This project adopted the Plan-Do-Study-Act process as its change model. A bundled intervention was introduced including early referrals to the therapy team for newly admitted patients, staff education, and providing supplemental patient education. The measurable outcome was to achieve a decrease in fall rates. Although the goal was not achieved within the 3-month timeframe, data did indicate a positive trend toward the intended goal. Results indicated ongoing opportunities for nurses to enhance reliability in making therapy referrals. However, nurses demonstrated consistency in providing supplemental education.

Tools for Co‐designing approaches to enhance falls management after spinal cord injury in an Australian spinal injuries unit.

Co‐designing approaches to enhance falls management after spinal cord injury in an Australian spinal injuries unit.
By:Marshall, Kathryn;Liddle, Jacki;Gustafsson, Louise;+3 moreIn:Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Aug2025, volume 72, issue 4, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Introduction: Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk of falls because of changes in sensation and motor function. While research exists on the consumer and clinician perspective of falls and fall prevention, these groups have not been brought together to determine how to effectively address this issue. The study aimed to co‐design approaches to enhance falls management including prevention of falls and post fall management, after SCI in inpatient spinal rehabilitation. Methods: Using an experience‐based co‐design process, six consumers and eight clinicians, including occupational therapists, each participated in multiple focus groups and/or individual interviews. Data were collected over three cycles and were used to (1) share and explore the experience and perspectives of falls after SCI, (2) determine possible approaches to enhance services currently offered, and (3) develop and refine principles to enhance falls management. Data analysis followed an interpretive description approach with constant comparative analysis. Following each cycle, researchers engaged in discussion, generated themes, and tested ideas in the following cycle. Consumer and community involvement: This research was completed with people with lived experience of SCI. Co‐investigators with lived experience of SCI were involved in the planning and conduct of the study. Findings: It was agreed that falls management is required lifelong for persons with SCI, although the important role of inpatient preparation was highlighted. Different perspectives were shared with consensus met on key issues and actions to address falls in the inpatient setting. Practice principles produced included getting everyone on the same page, learning to move safely through experience‐based learning, understanding it is more than just falls, and the need for individualised practice. Conclusion: This work has combined experiences and perspectives from consumers and clinicians with approaches developed for future service improvement to enhance falls management for people with SCI in inpatient spinal rehabilitation PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY This work asked people with spinal cord injury and people working in the hospital about falls in hospital. It wanted to find ways to improve how people can plan for and deal with falls in hospital and when they leave hospital. A series of one‐on‐one and group interviews found out about problems with how hospitals help people with falls now and ways to make it better. We learnt that people with spinal cord injury and people working in the hospital both need to work together. Also, people with spinal cord injury want to practice tasks to prepare for and deal with falls. They want to learn about how to be assertive and want education to be made just for them. This study shows how hospitals can improve what they are doing about falls.

Patient falls are a frequent safety issue in inpatient rehabilitation settings, especially during early admission days when patients face physical limitations and unfamiliar environments. This study reveals high-risk periods for falls that align with peak patient activities and staff shift changes. The findings suggest that targeted fall prevention strategies during these times could significantly enhance patient safety and optimize staff resources in rehabilitation facilities. Falls are a significant safety concern in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, where patients often face increased risk due to functional impairments. This retrospective study examined fall trends across days after admission and daily 2-hr intervals within a single rehabilitation hospital. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant decline in fall rates over time, suggesting a decrease in fall risk as patients acclimate and improve physically. However, two peak periods for falls were identified during early morning and evening hours, aligning with heightened patient activity and staff shift changes. These findings emphasize the need for targeted fall prevention strategies during the initial days after admission and specific high-risk times of the day. Implementing tailored interventions for these critical periods may reduce fall incidents and enhance patient safety in rehabilitation settings.

Purpose: Difficulty with communicating basic needs and attracting the attention of health professionals may contribute to falls for patients with communication disability after stroke. The aim of this study was to explore the views of hospital-based health professionals on: (a) the effect of communication disability on falls in patients with stroke; (b) falls prevention strategies for patients with communication disability following stroke; and (c) the roles of speech pathologists in the assessment, management, and prevention of falls in this population. Materials and Methods: Online focus groups were conducted and analysed using content thematic analysis. Results: In total, 11 health professionals participated in four focus groups. Clinicians viewed that: (a) the effects of falls in patients with communication disability are far-reaching; (b) communication disability complicates falls risk assessment and falls management; (c) current falls prevention strategies do not meet the needs of patients with communication disability; and (d) strong relationships have a central role in decreasing falls in this population. Conclusions: Health professionals articulate concerning gaps in falls prevention strategies for patients with communication disability. Further research should investigate strategies enabling falls prevention and management to be more inclusive of patients with communication disability following stroke and consider ways in which speech pathologists could contribute to this field. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Hospital patients with communication disability after stroke have unique factors that contribute to falls Communication disability complicates falls assessment and prevention strategies Speech pathologists can assist with identifying contributing factors for falls related to communication disability Multidisciplinary teams should consider implementing explicit communication strategies for tasks that are typically associated with falls in patients with stroke

Why you should read this article: • To acknowledge the importance of using multifactorial falls risk assessment and multidomain, personalised interventions to reduce falls risks in hospitals • To read about strategies used by nurse leaders to support delivery of falls prevention practices in hospitals • To recognise the actions required to support nurse leaders to deliver multifactorial falls prevention practices in hospitals. Despite prevention efforts, falls in hospital are a common and ongoing safety concern, with older people more likely to fall and experience harm as a result of falls. Clinical guidelines recommend multifactorial falls risk assessment and multidomain, personalised interventions to reduce falls risks in hospitals. This article reflects on findings from a multi-site study on the implementation of multifactorial falls prevention practices that informed the development of actionable guidance. The discussion focuses on strategies used by nurse leaders, at different levels of seniority, that shaped practice on orthopaedic and older person wards. While falls risk assessment documentation was monitored routinely by senior leaders, in practice falls prevention often relied on risk screening and enhanced patient supervision. Findings suggest that nurses need to be empowered to lead practices that modify and mitigate individual falls risks where possible, with greater multidisciplinary and patient and carer involvement.

Considerations across multiple stakeholder groups when implementing fall prevention programs in the acute hospital setting: a qualitative study.
By:McLennan, Charlotte;Sherrington, Catherine;Tilden, Wendy;+7 moreIn:Age & Ageing, 2024, volume 53, issue 10, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background Falls in hospital remain a common and costly patient safety issue internationally. There is evidence that falls in hospitals can be prevented by multifactorial programs and by education for patients and staff, but these are often not routinely or effectively implemented in practice. Perspectives of multiple key stakeholder groups could inform implementation of fall prevention strategies. Methods Clinicians of different disciplines, patients and their families were recruited from wards at two acute public hospitals. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted to gain a broad understanding of participants' perspectives about implementing fall prevention programs. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Results Data from 50 participants revealed three key themes across the stakeholder groups shaping implementation of acute hospital fall prevention programs: (i) 'Fall prevention is a priority, but whose?' where participants agreed falls in hospital should be addressed but did not necessarily see themselves as responsible for this; (ii) 'Disempowered stakeholders' where participants expressed feeling frustrated and powerless with fall prevention in acute hospital settings; and (iii) 'Shared responsibility may be a solution' where participants were optimistic about the positive impact of collective action on effectively implementing fall prevention strategies. Conclusion Key stakeholder groups agree that hospital fall prevention is a priority, however, challenges related to role perception, competing priorities, workforce pressure and disempowerment mean fall prevention may often be neglected in practice. Improving shared responsibility for fall prevention implementation across disciplines, organisational levels and patients, family and staff may help overcome this.

By:Pellegrino, Allison;Brook, KarolinaIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Sep2024, volume 20, issue 6, pages e87-e90CINAHL
Despite advances in patient safety, perioperative patient falls continue to be a persistent and preventable harm. Patient falls in procedural areas have been associated with multiple postoperative complications such as additional falls, functional decline, and hospital readmissions. Although fall-related databases exist, the specific number of periprocedural falls is difficult to ascertain, and the causes of such falls also remain elusive. We explore various solutions and recommend the creation of a national, focused database of periprocedural falls that will allow institutions to track numbers of falls in patients receiving anesthetic care and to identify the most common etiologies to enable the implementation of targeted strategies to prevent falls. Lacking this, we suggest specific screening and procedural recommendations during all phases of anesthetic care to increase providers’ awareness and vigilance surrounding patient falls.

By:Buongiorno, Luigi;Mele, Federica;Solarino, Biagio;+7 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety & Risk Management, Jun2024, volume 29, issue 3, pages 165-172 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Hospital falls are a frequent sentinel event worldwide, yet prevention remains challenging. There is a need to standardize hospital fall management in healthcare facilities. This study aimed to analyze policies and procedures used by Italian healthcare facilities to reduce hospital falls. Methods: The Italian hospitals' public procedures on patients' falls issued between November 2011 and June 2022 were retrieved by a web search using the Google search engine and further evaluated according to their compliance with the 2011 Italian Ministerial recommendation for the prevention of patients' falls. Results: We found 37 official online procedures, of which 45.6% showed full compliance with the 2011 Ministerial recommendation. All the documents explicitly addressed the issue of identifying patient-related fall risk profiles, whereas 28 set appropriate environmental risk factors. More than 80% of the retrieved procedures used the Conley scale. Forty-three percent of the procedures did not provide for national monitoring and reporting of patient falls. Conclusions: Public procedures for preventing patient falls in Italian hospitals are scarcely compliant with the 2011 Ministerial recommendation. Local monitoring, compliance, and reporting of hospital falls are needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of litigation for staff and organizations. Additionally, standardized tools for evaluating the risk of falls, healthcare professionals' training, and implementing environmental prevention strategies are needed to contrast this issue.

Hospital policies on falls in relation to patients with communication disability: a scoping review and content analysis.
By:Sullivan, Rebecca;Hemsley, Bronwyn;Skinner, Ian;+1 moreIn:Australian Health Review, 2023, volume 47, issue 4, pages 487-493 (7p)CINAHL
Objective: Falls in hospital are a significant public health issue and patients with communication disability have unique risk factors that have the potential to contribute to falls. The aim of this study is to determine how the content of hospital falls policies relate to patients with communication disability and to identify gaps in policy that need to be addressed. Methods: A scoping review and content analysis of (a) policies and related documents, from a target health service in Victoria, Australia, and all relevant Australian state and territory health departments, and (b) national guidelines was performed. Data were analysed for content relating to inclusion of patients with communication disability. Results: Communication disability is not captured as a risk factor for a fall in assessment tools. When included, aspects of communication disability were often conflated with cognitive impairments. There was little guidance for staff on adapting falls prevention education to suit the needs of patients with communication disability and limited identified role for speech pathologists. Conclusion: This study suggests that a patient's communication disability is not visible in hospital falls policies and guidelines. What is known about the topic? Falls prevention is an important part of the national health policy agenda and there is extensive literature informing hospital policy and guidelines. What does the paper add? This study provides insights into how hospital falls policies and guidelines relate to the assessment of risk, and prevention of falls in people with communication disability. What are the implications for practitioners? The results suggest that a patient's communication disability is not considered in falls risk assessment, or prevention plans. Communication disability should not be a barrier to engaging patients in this process.

Background: Patient falls are a major adverse event in psychiatric inpatient care. Purpose: To model the risk for patient falls in seclusion rooms in psychiatric inpatient care. Methods: Sociotechnical probabilistic risk assessment (ST-PRA) was used to model the risk for falls. Data sources were the research team, literature review, and exploration groups of psychiatric nurses. Data were analyzed with fault tree analysis. Results: The risk for a patient fall in a seclusion room was 1.8%. Critical paths included diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, the mechanism of falls, failure to assess and prevent falls, and psychological or physical reason. The most significant individual risk factor for falls was diagnosis of schizophrenia. Conclusions: Falls that occur in seclusion events are associated with physical and psychological risk factors. Therefore, risk assessment methods and fall prevention interventions considering patient behavioral disturbance and physiological risk factors in seclusion are warranted.

Aim: Falls in hospital as a major cause of disability and death threaten patients' safety and quality of life. We studied fall incidence in hospital, and predicted its risk factors using weighted Poisson (WP) model versus other models. Method: This cross-sectional study was performed on the patients referred to two central hospitals in Qazvin, Iran between 2017 and 2019. The data were collected using the Morse scale and fall reporting forms in the hospital patient safety units (288 falls). Factors including age, gender, time of fall, fall location, cause of fall and its complications, drugs administrated, disease history, post-fall care measures, presence of companion, and length of hospital stay were assessed. The WP model was compared with other models. Results: Fall incidence was 2.5 per 1000 patient days. Among them, 62.5% were elderly (mean age 65.7 ± 19.21 yr). Using the WP model, age, gender, fall location and fall cause, drugs administered, post-fall care measures (P < 0.001), and the presence of companion were identified as risk factors for falling (P < 0.001) Older females, those without a companion, and those without post-fall care measures and with medication history were at a higher risk. Falls from bed were the prevalent type of fall (IRR = 1.65). Falls in the internal ward were lower than in other wards (IRR = 0.67). Conclusion: The WP model is suggested as an appropriate model to predict fall risk factors. Fall rate may be reduced by combining information on risk factors with the strategies of training nurses or caregivers, or making possible changes in patients' environment.

Objectives: Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incidents and are associated with serious injuries. This study aimed to use multifactorial interventions to reduce the delays to the diagnosis of serious injury in a time series analysis after serious incidents relating to falls within a central London Trust. Methods : A multiprofessional project team undertook process mapping to identify opportunities for improvement at different stages in the management of a fall. The interventions included an educational teaching session aimed at doctors, a lanyard card designed by doctors using the plan-do-study-act methodology, a falls-specific pager for radiographers, and a new system to refer to portering. Quantitative data were obtained using an serious incident database where serious injury occurred (SI data; n = 65) and routinely collected incident reporting database on falls regardless of injury (IR data; n = 178). Qualitative questionnaire data (n = 70) were also used to evaluate doctors' confidence in falls assessment before and after interventions. Results : Results in the IR data demonstrated a significant reduction in the median (interquartile range) minutes delay in the time to review a patient after a fall from 81 (43-180) to 51 (26-112; P = 0.003) and the time to order imaging from 102 (45-370) to 50 (33-96; P = 0.04). Analysis of the SI database demonstrated a nonstatistically significant reduction in the overall time taken to detect serious injury after a fall from 348 (126-756) to 192 (108-384) minutes (P = 0.070). Furthermore, analysis using statistical process control charts showed evidence of special cause variation and a shift in the process in detecting serious harm after a fall. Junior doctors' confidence in investigations improved from 53% to 76% (P = 0.04) after the intervention. Conclusions : The cumulative application of multiple interventions with small individual effects resulted in a substantial positive effect on delays and variability in diagnosis of serious harm. Given a similar institutional context, the more effective interventions in our study could be adopted elsewhere.

Tools for An opportunistic evaluation of a routine service improvement project to reduce falls in hospital.

An opportunistic evaluation of a routine service improvement project to reduce falls in hospital.

Background: Preventing falls in hospital is a perennial patient safety issue. The University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire initiated a programme to train ward staff in accordance with guidelines. The National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care West Midlands was asked to expedite an independent evaluation of the initiative. We set out to describe the intervention to implement the guidelines and to evaluate it by means of a step-wedge cluster study using routinely collected data.Methods: The evaluation was set up as a partially randomised, step-wedge cluster study, but roll-out across wards was more rapid than planned. The study was therefore analysed as a time-series. Primary outcome was rate of falls per 1000 Occupied Bed Days (OBDs) collected monthly using routine data. Data was analysed using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, with a fixed effect for intervention, time and post-intervention time. We allowed for random variations across clusters in initial fall rate, pre-intervention slope and post-intervention slope.Results: There was an average of 6.62 falls per 1000 OBDs in the control phase, decreasing to an average of 5.89 falls per 1000 OBDs in the period after implementation to the study end. Regression models showed no significant step change in fall rates (IRR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92-1.14). However, there was a gradual decrease, of approximately 3%, after the intervention was introduced (IRR: 0.97 per month, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99).Conclusion: The intervention was associated with a small but statistically significantly improvement in falls rates. Expedited roll-out of an intervention may vitiate a step-wedge cluster design, but the intervention can still be studied using a time-series analysis. Assuming that there is some value in time series analyses, this is better than no evaluation at all. However, care is needed in making causal inferences given the non-experimental nature of the design.

Patient falls in the operating room setting: An analysis of reported safety events.
By:Tan, Joy;Krishnan, Sindhu;Vacanti, Joshua C.;+4 moreIn:Journal of Healthcare Risk Management, Jul2022, volume 42, issue 1, pages 9-14 (6p)CINAHL
Introduction: Patient falls are a preventable public health problem, and they are among the most reported safety incidents in the hospital. We used a hospital safety reporting system to examine the nature of reported falls in the perioperative setting at an academic tertiary center. Methods: In this retrospective study, reports of perioperative safety events listed as "Falls" between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed for severity level and specific event type. Results: Out of 8337 safety reports from 2014 to 2020, 86 were "fall" related (1%). The most common "fall" event type was "ambulating with assistance and the severity level reported was mainly level 1 (no harm, did reach patient, 63%) followed by level 2 (temporary or minor harm, 28%). One of the most frequently reported types of perioperative falls was from a bed or stretcher (15% of falls)". Conclusions: Our safety data reporting system identified falls as a safety event that causes patient harm in the perioperative setting that could be preventable with a multifaceted interdisciplinary approach. Risk managers can use these data to implement strategies to reduce falls such as creating screening protocols to identify high‐risk patients, educating and training healthcare personnel, and optimizing operating room, hospital, and equipment design.

Tools for Factors influencing patient falls in a private hospital group in the Cape Metropole of the Western Cape.

Factors influencing patient falls in a private hospital group in the Cape Metropole of the Western Cape.
By:van Rensburg, Renee Janse;van der Merwe, Anita;Crowley, TalithaIn:Health SA Gesondheid, 2020, volume 25, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
Background: The fall rate of patients in hospitals is a worldwide concern due to the impact falls have on patients, the family or relatives, as well as the healthcare setting. Factors influencing patient falls are categorised as intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors refers to physical conditions and the extrinsic factors include the environment of the patient, nursing staffing levels and skill mix. Aim: The study aimed to determine the factors that influence patient falls. Setting: A private hospital group in the Cape Metropole of the Western Cape. Methods: A quantitative retrospective descriptive research approach was used by analysing 134 records of patients that have fallen from October 2016 to February 2018. Data was collected using a data extraction sheet and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: Intrinsic factors contributing to patient falls includedthe patient's age, hypertension, co-morbidities and the use of benzodiazepines as a sedative. Extrinsic factors were the incorrect use of bed rails and the skill mix of the staff. In over half of the cases (n = 68; 50.7%), risk assessments were not performed according to the protocol. Only 5 (3.7%) patients sustained major injuries due to the falls. However, the risk of more severe falls increased 2.4 times with the lack of risk assessment. Conclusion: The lack of accurate and consistent patient fall risk assessments, use of benzodiazepines as a sedative and the staff skill mix were contributors to the fall rate in these hospitals.

Objective: To understand the perception and experience of health professionals regarding fall prevention practices in hospital inpatient units. Method: This is a qualitative exploratory and descriptive case study based on the Canadian framework of interprofessional competences. Data was collected from two focus groups, with different health professionals in each group, and thematic content analysis was used. Results: Five categories were drawn up which showed intense convergence between the participants of the two focus groups, within the context of fall prevention practices: communication between professionals and patients/carers for fall prevention, interprofessional communication for fall prevention, clarification of roles for fall prevention, health education about risk and fall prevention and continuing education for fall prevention. Conclusion: Teamwork and collaborative practice are important for achieving good results in the prevention of falls in hospital care, but for this to happen, health professionals need to acquire the necessary competences for collaborative action.

Tools for Falls in hospital: a case–control study.

Falls in hospital: a case–control study.
By:de Groot, Gudrun Cathrine Lindgren;Al‐Fattal, Ahmad;Sandven, IreneIn:Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, Jun2020, volume 34, issue 2, pages 332-339 (8p)CINAHL
Aims: Falls among inpatients are common. The method used by The Norwegian Patient Safety Campaign to measure the adverse events is the Global Trigger Tool, which does not look at the causation for falls. This study was aimed at investigating major risk factors for falls in the hospital setting. Methods: This retrospective case–control study was conducted at Telemark Hospital in Norway, in the period from September 2012 to August 2014. A total of 842 patients from three wards were included, whereof 172 cases had experienced one or more fall(s) during hospitalisation and 670 random controls had not fallen. Data were analysed according to a pragmatic strategy. Results: Compared with patients who did not fall, patients who fell were 21 times more likely to have poor balance (OR = 21.50, 95% CI: 10.26–45.04) and 19 times more likely to have very poor balance (OR = 19.62, 95% CI: 9.55–40.27), twice as likely to be men (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.24–2.68), and 50% increased probability of fall with every 10 year increase of age (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.34–1.69). Furthermore, the patients who fell were more likely to use antidepressant drugs (OR = 3.85, 95% CI: 1.09–13.63), antipsychotic drugs (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.94–5.51), anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.22–2.67) and antiepileptic drugs (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11–4.06) than patients who did not fall. Conclusions: During hospital stay, patients who fell had a higher risk profile than patients who did not fall. Clinicians should work to improve patients' safety and reduce the risk of falls by accurately assessing balance and mobility as a form of primary prevention. We recommend that a review of the patient medications should be conducted upon falling, as a form of a secondary preventive strategy against falls.

Tools for Sitters as a Patient Safety Strategy to Reduce Hospital Falls: A Systematic Review.

Sitters as a Patient Safety Strategy to Reduce Hospital Falls: A Systematic Review.
By:Greeley, Adela M.;Tanner, Elizabeth P.;Mak, Selene;+3 moreIn:Annals of Internal Medicine, 03/03/2020, volume 172, issue 5, pages 317-324 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Bedside "sitters" are often used for patients at high risk for falls, but they are expensive and their effectiveness is unclear.Purpose: To review evidence about the effect of sitters and alternatives to sitters on patient falls in acute care hospitals.Data Sources: PubMed searches to 8 October 2019, other databases from inception to December 2018, citation searches on key articles, and a Google search (22 October 2019).Study Selection: English-language studies of any design that assessed the effect of adding sitters to usual care or compared alternatives to sitters (for example, video monitors or "close observation units") for adult patients on general wards of acute care hospitals and reported falls as a primary outcome.Data Extraction: Dual-reviewer extraction of study data and risk of bias; single reviewer with group discussion for GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) certainty of evidence.Data Synthesis: Of 20 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 2 added sitters to usual care and 18 compared alternatives to sitters. There were no randomized trials, 11 time-series studies, 1 retrospective quasi-experimental study, and 8 pre-post studies. All studies had at least 1 methodological limitation. Two studies provided very-low-certainty evidence that adding sitters reduced falls. Eight studies provided moderate-certainty evidence that interventions that included video monitoring reduced sitter use and either did not affect or reduced the number of falls. Very-low-certainty evidence suggested that interventions that included nurse assessment tools (3 studies) or a close observation unit (2 studies) were effective alternatives to sitters.Limitation: No studies had low risk of bias, publication bias is likely, and studies may have been missed.Conclusion: Despite a compelling rationale, evidence is scant that adding sitters to usual care reduces falls.Primary Funding Source: Veterans Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative.

Multilevel factors influencing falls of patients in hospital: The impact of nurse staffing.
By:Kim, Jinhyun;Kim, Sungjae;Park, Jinhee;+1 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Management, Jul2019, volume 27, issue 5, pages 1011-1019 (9p)CINAHL
Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate both individual and organizational factors influencing the falls of patients in hospitals. Background: Falls and fall‐related injuries, which cause health problems and increase the economic burden to patients, are a critical issue for patient safety. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed patient data and analysed factors influencing patient falls using a mixed‐effect model. Results: The total number of patients in the study was 60,049, and the characteristics of the patients showed statistically significant differences according to the type of hospital where the fall occurred. The average rate of falls was 0.92 per 1,000 days. The rate of falls in general hospitals was the highest among all hospitals. Age, mobility impairment and hours per patient day for care delivered by registered nurses were factors influencing patients' falls. Conclusion: Since the number of patient falls in an acute‐care setting might increase in the future because of the growing elderly population, we should consider these risk factors for falls and construct preventative programs accordingly. Implications for nursing management: An adequate level of nursing staff is an essential factor in the number of patient falls.

Tools for Patient Safety Incidents Describing Patient Falls in Critical Care in North West England Between 2009 and 2017.

Patient Safety Incidents Describing Patient Falls in Critical Care in North West England Between 2009 and 2017.
By:Thomas, Antony N.;Balmforth, Joanna E.In:Journal of Patient Safety, Mar2021, volume 17, issue 2, pages e71-e75CINAHL
Aim: The aim of the study was to review reported falls in critical care units to see whether the causes and results were different from those described in a general hospital population. Methods: We reviewed and classified patient safety incidents describing falls from critical care units in the North West of England between 2009 and 2017. The classification reviewed patient and staff factors contributing to the fall, the environment of the fall, and the reported consequences. We then calculated and compared rates of falls in different units. Results: There were 914 falls reported, representing only 2.0% of all reported incidents. The median (interquartile range) unit rate was 1.0 falls per 1000 (0.5–1.2) days, and falls were unrelated to the number of single rooms and were no more common in specialist units. There were 304 (33%) falls in patients transferring (207 to standing, 8 from standing), and there were 259 (28%) falls from bed. Patient factors included attempting tasks without assistance (323 incidents [35%]) and organic confusion (188 incidents [21%]). Staff factors included being away from the patient (375 incidents [41%]). Harm was described in 201 incidents (22%), including removal of medical devices (40 incidents), injury to staff (10 incidents) subdural hematoma, and possible spinal injury (1 incident each). Conclusions: There is a low rate of falls and associated harm in critical care units. The variation between units suggests that this rate could be further reduced by the prevention and management of delirium and by educating patients and staff to take care when moving patients to the standing position.

Tools for Analysis of Falls within Paediatric Hospital and Community Healthcare Settings.

Analysis of Falls within Paediatric Hospital and Community Healthcare Settings.
By:Parker, Caitlin;Kellaway, Jasmine;Stockton, KellieIn:Journal of Pediatric Nursing, Jan2020, volume 50, pages 31-36 (6p)CINAHL
To identify characteristics of paediatric falls within a healthcare setting. A retrospective analysis of falls occurring within inpatient, outpatient, emergency and community healthcare settings of children aged 0–<18 years was conducted using data from the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service (CHQ-HHS) Clinical Incident Database and Electronic Medical Record between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. One-sample and two-sample Chi-squared tests with post-hoc tests were performed to assess relationships between categorical variables. The final dataset contained 385 fall events. Children 0–2 years fell most frequently (46.75%) and falls were higher in males (55.58%). Falls from bed were the most common mechanism (30.65%). The incidence rate of inpatient falls was 0.53 falls per 1000 bed days in the tertiary hospital setting and 1.2% of presentations to inpatient community health facilities. Falls from bed were most common in the tertiary hospital inpatient setting (39.84%, p <.001) and the emergency department (72.13%, p <.001). Falls from furniture/equipment constituted 26.04% of outpatient falls. Most falls occurred in the presence of parents/caregivers (79.48%) and 4.66% of fallers sustained multiple falls. This study provides a comprehensive review of the characteristics of fall events in CHQ-HHS over a three-year period and summarises the existing literature in paediatric fall prevention. Risk assessment and management plans should focus on education, particularly surrounding bed safety. Our findings have informed the development of an integrated evidence-based paediatric-specific fall risk assessment tool and management plan to prevent falls in hospital and community healthcare settings. • Falls contribute to adverse hospital events and have a negative impact on safety. • Falls from bed are common and are often associated with improper side-rail use. • Prevention programs must include education and identification of at risk patients. • Fall prevention education should be targeted based on identified fall mechanisms. • This data informed development of a paediatric risk assessment and prevention plan.

Root Cause Analysis of Reported Patient Falls in ORs in the Veterans Health Administration.
By:Soncrant, Christina M.;Warner, Lisa J.;Neily, Julia;+5 moreIn:AORN Journal, Oct2018, volume 108, issue 4, pages 386-397 (12p)CINAHL
Abstract: This quality improvement project describes 22 OR patient falls reported in the Veterans Health Administration between January 2010 and February 2016. Most (n = 15; 68%) involved patient falls from the OR bed. Other patient falls (n = 6; 27%) occurred when the patient was transferred to or from the OR bed, and one fall (5%) occurred at another time. Root causes of the falls included tilting of the OR bed, issues with safety restraints, malfunctioning OR bed or gurney locks, inadequate patient sedation, and poor communication among team members. One fall (5%) resulted in a major injury, four falls (18%) resulted in minor injuries, six falls resulted in no injury, and 11 falls (50%) had no reported outcome. Falls in the OR, although rare, can be injurious. We drafted recommendations based on the root causes that include specific guidance on communication, teamwork, best practices, restraints and equipment, and training.

In-Hospital Sequelae of Injurious Falls in 24 Medical/Surgical Units in Four Hospitals in the United States.
By:Hill, Anne-Marie;Jacques, Angela;Chandler, A. Michelle;+3 moreIn:Joint Commission Journal on Quality & Patient Safety, Feb2019, volume 45, issue 2, pages 91-97 (7p)CINAHL
Background: Up to 50% of patient falls in the hospital result in injury. This study was conducted to determine whether injurious falls were associated with increased hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge to a place other than home, and in-hospital mortality. Methods: A secondary data analysis from a prospective case-control study was conducted in 24 medical/surgical units in four hospitals in the United States. Patients who fell and sustained an injury were matched with at least one control patient who was on the same unit, at the same time, for a similar number of days on the unit at the time of the fall. Data were collected by viewing patients' electronic health records, as well as the hospitals' incident reporting systems. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were conducted. Results: The 1,033 patients (mean age, 63.7 years; 510 males [49.4%]) who sustained an injurious fall were matched with 1,206 controls (mean age, 61.6 years; 486 males [40.3%]). Fallers were significantly more likely than controls to stay longer than 10 days in the hospital (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.46-1.74) and to be discharged to a place other than home (OR, 1.52; 95% CI = 1.21-1.91). Conclusion: Compared to controls, hospital patients who sustained an injurious fall had longer LOS and were more likely discharged to a place other than home. These associations remained when controlling for patient-level confounders, suggesting that the fall altered trajectory was sustained toward these outcomes. Injurious falls were not significantly associated with increased risk of mortality.

Key issues to consider and innovative ideas on fall prevention in the geriatric department of a teaching hospital.

Falls in hospital are common and up to 70% result in injury, leading to increased length of stay and accounting for 10% of patient safety-related deaths. Yet, high-quality evidence guiding best practice is lacking. Fall prevention strategies have worked in some trials but not in others. Differences in study setting (acute, subacute, rehabilitation) and sampling of patients (cognitively intact or impaired) may explain the difference in results. This article discusses these important issues and describes the strategies to prevent falls in the acute hospital setting we have studied, which engage the cognitively impaired who are more likely to fall. We have used video clips rather than verbal instruction to educate patients, and are optimistic that this approach may work. We have also explored the option of co-locating high fall risk patients in a close observation room for supervision, with promising results. Further studies, using larger sample sizes are required to confirm our findings.

Tools for Association Between Characteristics of Injurious Falls and Fall Preventive Interventions in Acute Medical and Surgical Units.

Association Between Characteristics of Injurious Falls and Fall Preventive Interventions in Acute Medical and Surgical Units.
By:Francis-Coad, Jacqueline;Hill, Anne-Marie;Jacques, Angela;+4 moreIn:Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences, Oct2020, volume 75, issue 10, pages e152-e158CINAHL
Background: Hospital falls remain common and approximately 30% of falls in hospital result in injury. The aims of the study were the following: (i) to identify the association between fall interventions present at the time of the injurious fall and injurious faller characteristics and (ii) to identify the association between fall preventive interventions present at the time of the injurious fall and the injurious fall circumstances.Methods: Secondary data analysis of deidentified case series of injurious falls across 24 acute medical/surgical units in the United States. Variables of interest were falls prevention interventions (physical therapy, bed alarm, physical restraint, room change, or a sitter) in place at the time of fall. Data were analyzed using logistic regression and hazard ratios.Results: There were 1,033 patients with an injurious fall, occurrence peaked between Day 1 and Day 4, with 46.8% of injurious falls having occurred by Day 3 of admission. Injurious fallers with a recorded mental state change 24 hours prior to the fall were more likely to have a bed alarm provided (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61, 4.08) and receive a physical restraint as fall prevention interventions (adjusted OR 6.36, 95% CI 4.35, 9.30). Injurious fallers restrained fell later (stay Day 6) than those without a restraint (stay Day 4) (p = .007) and had significantly longer lengths of stay (13 days vs 9 days).Conclusions: On medical/surgical units, injurious falls occur early following admission suggesting interventions should be commenced immediately. Injurious fallers who had a physical restraint as an intervention had longer lengths of stay.

Tools for The association of malnutrition with falls and harm from falls in hospital inpatients: Findings from a 5‐year observational study.

The association of malnutrition with falls and harm from falls in hospital inpatients: Findings from a 5‐year observational study.
By:Lackoff, Ariel S.;Hickling, Donna;Collins, Peter F.;+3 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Feb2020, volume 29, issue 3/4, pages 429-436 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Inpatient falls continue to be a significant clinical issue, and while malnutrition is a known risk factors for falls, few studies have investigated its association with inpatient falls. This study aimed to explore the independent association between malnutrition and fall risk as well as harm from falls in hospital inpatients. Methods: Malnutrition identified in annual malnutrition audits was combined with inpatient fall data captured through the electronic patient incident reporting system in the 12 months following audit days. Audit data were available for 1,849 inpatients across 2011–2015, and covariate associations between age, gender, BMI, malnutrition, falls and harmful falls were analysed. The reporting of this paper is in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations (see Appendix S1). Results: The prevalence of malnutrition was 32.4% (n = 543), and 171 (9.2%) inpatients experienced a fall with 0.7% (n = 13) categorised as harmful. In bivariate analysis, patients who fell were more likely to be older (median 79.0 vs. 70.0 years; p <.0001) or malnourished (40.9% vs. 31.5%; p =.021). Malnutrition (p <.0001) and having a lower BMI (p =.026) were significant predictors of harmful falls. Regression modelling demonstrated that only increasing age increased the likelihood of having an inpatient fall (OR 1.022 95% CI 1.021–1.046; p <.0001). Malnourished inpatients were almost 8 times more likely to have a harmful fall than those not malnourished (OR 7.94 95% CI 1.457–43.338; p =.017), independent of age and BMI. Conclusions: Malnourished patients are more likely to experience a harmful fall. Assessment of malnutrition should be incorporated into fall risk assessments as a way of highlighting those patients at greater risk and to link to nutritional care pathways.

Aims: To describe falls causing injury, types of injuries, and the reporting of these falls. Methods: Administrative and incident reporting datasets between July 2012 and June 2017 were analyzed. Results: Using both datasets, 5,653 falls were identified (3.7 per 1,000 bed-days). Administrative and incident datasets accounted for 40.8% (2,299) and 84.4% (4,752) of falls, respectively. More than half the falls in the administrative data required only observation/examination (1,221 falls; 53.1%, 0.8 per 1,000 bed-days). The remaining 1,078 falls (46.9%; 0.7 per 1,000 bed-days) caused 1,533 injuries (1.0 per 1,000 bed-days). Most injuries happened in patients who were 65 years or older (73.9%), during the first episode of care (79.0%), in the acute care setting (70.4%), or on the same level (60.1%). The most common injuries were to the head (33.3%). Some injuries were serious (169; 11.0%; 0.11 per 1,000 bed-days). Falls resulting in injury in older patients, with a more severe medical condition and at smaller hospitals, were more likely to be recorded in the incident reporting system whereas subsequent falls were less likely to be recorded. Conclusions: Fewer than half of the falls recorded in administrative data resulted in injuries. A tenth of all falls caused serious injuries.

Tools for Exploring effective factors in reducing the fall of hospitalized patients: A systematic review.

Exploring effective factors in reducing the fall of hospitalized patients: A systematic review.
In:Archives of Trauma Research, Jul-Sep2021, volume 10, issue 3, pages 133-140 (8p)CINAHL
Background and Objectives: Patient's fall is one of the factors threatening a patient's health in hospitals and medical centers, which in some cases can lead to disability or death. Therefore, this study was conducted to systematically examine the factors affecting the reduction of patient falls in the hospital. Materials and Methods: This systematic review was conducted to identify the factors affecting the reduction of patient's fall in the hospitals based on the Prisma protocol. On this basis, all English-language articles published in this field from 1990 to the end of September 2019 were extracted during a search in four international databases and publishers including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Articles were searched and screened by three researchers independently and finally, the extracted articles were analyzed and classified through thematic content analysis. Results: According to the Prisma protocol, 6227 studies were extracted, of which 32 studies were finally included in the study process. Then, the thematic analysis of the studies showed that factors such as education, exercise, attention to physiological factors and treatment of the disease, environmental safety, use of fall detection device, and patient risk assessment were effective in reducing falls. Conclusions: The findings show that existing approaches to reduce falls have a favorable role. It is necessary to use several methods of fall prevention at the same time, in order to control most aspects and factors affecting the fall and reduce the rate of fall.

Tools for Frailty as a predictor of future falls in hospitalized patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Frailty as a predictor of future falls in hospitalized patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
By:Lan, Xiuyan;Li, Hong;Wang, Zijuan;+1 moreIn:Geriatric Nursing, Mar2020, volume 41, issue 2, pages 69-74 (6p)CINAHL
• Frailty is a significant predictor of future falls in hospital patients. • Nurses should identify whether a patient is frail. • Nurses may consider to perform multifactorial fall-prevention programs including frailty treatment. The aims of this review were to identify prospective studies examining associations between frailty and falls and to combine the risk measures to synthesize pooled evidence on frailty as a predictor of falls. A systematic literature search was conducted through Embase, Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library for studies published from inception through May 2018. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) extracted from the studies were combined to synthesize pooled effect measures using random-effects or fixed-effects models. Six studies involving 3881 hospitalized patients were included in this study. Frailty was found to be significantly associated with future falls among three studies with OR (pooled OR = 1.323, 95%confidence interval = 1.137–1.538, P < 0.000) and three studies with HR (pooled OR = 1.890, 95%confidence interval = 1.456–2.453, P < 0.000). Frailty was a significant predictor of future falls in hospitalized patients. Paying more attention to frailty may lead to lowering fall risks.

Tools for Taking the Fall for Kids: A Journey to Reducing Pediatric Falls.

Taking the Fall for Kids: A Journey to Reducing Pediatric Falls.
By:Benning, Stephanie;Webb, TammyIn:Journal of Pediatric Nursing, May2019, volume 46, pages 100-108 (9p)CINAHL
To reduce harm related to pediatric falls, a quality improvement project was conducted at a children's hospital. An interprofessional team designed and implemented evidence-based interventions to align with the hospital's journey to reduce patient harm. These interventions included selection and implementation of a fall risk assessment tool, implementation of fall bundle elements, and implementation of fall prevention education to patients and families. Surveys, audits, and rate of falls were used to evaluate the project. Fall bundle compliance increased from 27% to 88% and there were zero patient falls in five out of the six months after implementation a comprehensive pediatric fall prevention program. Implementing pediatric-specific, evidence-based interventions can help to reduce patient falls. There was a substantial increase in fall bundle compliance and a decrease in falls and falls with injury. Practice Implications: Engagement and empowerment of clinical nurses in the quality improvement process design and implementation can substantially improve patient outcomes and patient safety while reducing harm. Future research is needed to determine factors that promote enhanced reporting needed to determine the true incidence of patient falls in pediatric inpatient and outpatient settings. • Nurses understand the importance of using an evidence-based fall risk assessment tool versus an internally developed tool. • Compliance with documentation and implementation of fall assessment and fall prevention interventions increased. • A decrease in pediatric falls with injury was demonstrated.

Tools for Intracranial haemorrhage detected by cerebral computed tomography after falls in hospital acute medical wards.

Intracranial haemorrhage detected by cerebral computed tomography after falls in hospital acute medical wards.
By:Stephen, Shiny;Wong, Elena W. W.;Idris, Adam M.;+1 moreIn:BMC Health Services Research, 04/11/2019, volume 19, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: There is little published data on brain imaging and intracranial haemorrhage after hospital inpatient falls. Imaging protocols for inpatient falls have been adopted from head injury guidelines developed from data in patients presenting to the Emergency Department. We sought to describe the use of brain computed tomography (CT) following inpatient falls, and determine the incidence and potential risk factors for intracranial haemorrhage.Methods: We identified inpatient falls in acute medical wards at Monash Health, a large hospital network in the southeast region of Melbourne in Australia, from the incident reporting system during a 32 month period. We examined the post-fall medical assessment form, neurological observation chart and the diagnostic imaging system for details of the fall and brain CT findings. We used survival analysis to evaluate the timeliness of brain imaging and determined potential risk factors for intracranial haemorrhage by logistic regression.Results: From 934 falls in 789 medical inpatients, 191 brain CT scans were performed. The median age of patients was 77 years. Only 55% of falls were from standing height and 24% experienced a head strike. Less than 10% of patients received an urgent scan within one hour, and timeliness of imaging was influenced by anticoagulation status rather than guideline determination of urgency. The overall incidence of intracranial haemorrhage was 0.9%. The factors associated with intracranial haemorrhage were head strike, anticoagulation, loss of consciousness or amnesia, drop in Glasgow Coma Scale and advanced chronic kidney disease.Conclusions: The incidence of intracranial haemorrhage was low as most inpatient falls were at low risk for head injury. Research is needed to determine if guidelines specific for hospital inpatients may reduce unnecessary scans without compromising case detection, and improve timeliness of urgent scans.

Background: Falls in hospital settings are frequent adverse events, with medications contributing significantly. Objective: To analyze inpatient fall notifications and characterize fall risk with a focus on drug therapy by applying the Medication Fall Risk Score. Methodology: An observational, descriptive, and retrospective study was conducted in a Portuguese hospital center. The Medication Fall Risk Score was applied to a sample of 183 patient fall notifications in the first quarter of 2021. Results: The Medication Fall Risk Score identified 60.6% of patients with "yes" for high fall risk. Regarding fall risk assessment recorded in the notifications using another scale, 65.8% of patients were classified as "low risk" or "no risk." Of these, 53.9% were classified as "yes" for high risk using the Medication Fall Risk Score. Conclusion: The Medication Fall Risk Score may help to improve the detection of patients at "high risk" of falling, allowing safer medication practices for fall prevention.

Tools for Do No Harm: A Multifactorial Approach to Preventing Emergency Department Falls—A Quality Improvement Project.

Do No Harm: A Multifactorial Approach to Preventing Emergency Department Falls—A Quality Improvement Project.
By:Cook, Nicole S.;Komansky, Brittany J.;Urton, Michael S.In:Journal of Emergency Nursing, Sep2020, volume 46, issue 5, pages 666-674 (9p)CINAHL
Patient falls in the emergency department are a unique patient safety issue because of the often challenging nature of the environment. As there are a variety of potential causative factors for patient falls in the emergency department, this project employed a multifactorial approach to prevent patient falls in a Level 1 trauma center emergency department (adult only) in an urban tertiary care teaching hospital. This project was a single-unit quality improvement intervention that compared postintervention monthly unit-level data to historic monthly rates on the same unit. The intervention was multifaceted with patient-level, nurse-level, and unit-level interventions employed. A task force was convened to review and identify specific departmental gaps related to fall prevention, complete a retrospective review of departmental patient falls to determine causative factors, and implement interventions to reduce ED falls. A comprehensive program consisting of an ED-specific fall risk assessment tool, remote video monitoring (RVM), stretcher alarms, and a robust patient safety culture, among other interventions, was implemented. Patient falls and falls with injuries were tracked as an outcome measure. After data driven analysis of causation, selection of key interventions, staff education, and sustained focus for 2 years, the department experienced a 27% decrease in falls and a 66% decrease in falls with injuries. A multifactorial approach was an effective strategy to decrease patient falls in the emergency department.

Tools for Patient falls in hospitals: An increasing problem.

Patient falls in hospitals: An increasing problem.
By:Weil, Thomas P.In:Geriatric Nursing, Sep/Oct2015, volume 36, issue 5, pages 342-347 (6p)CINAHL
Despite six decades of worldwide efforts that include publishing virtually hundreds of related epidemiological-type studies, there has been an increase (estimated to be 46% per 1000 patient days from 1954-6 to 2006-10) in the number of patient falls in hospitals and other health care facilities. These still occur most frequently near the bedside or in the bathroom, among mentally confused or physically impaired patients, and often involve those with greater comorbidity. The reasons that hospitals during the past half century have demonstrated a significant increase in patient falls per discharge or per patient days are numerous, are not completely surprising, and are certainly interrelated: improved accident reporting systems; on the average older, more impaired, more acutely ill, and more heavily sedated patients; and, less time spent by nursing personnel at the bedside. Most safety committees are not as effective as they should be, since they have difficulty in implementing a long-term, aggressive, facility-wide prevention program. Within that context, it may be worthwhile to discuss the advantages of nursing leadership rather than a representative of the facility's management staff to chair these safety committees.

Tools for Older patients and falls in hospital.

Older patients and falls in hospital.
By:Healey, Frances;Darowski, AdamIn:Clinical Risk, Sep2012, volume 18, issue 5, pages 170-176 (7p)CINAHL
Abstract: Over a quarter of a million falls are reported by the UK hospitals each year, predominantly harming older patients whose vulnerability to falling arises from a complex interaction of risk factors, including impaired mobility, dementia, delirium, medication and the effects of long term and acute illness. Systematic review of research trials indicates that multifactorial assessment and intervention to treat, modify or better manage these underlying risk factors can reduce falls by 20-30%. However, the evidence base is not always reflected in hospitals' falls prevention policies, and is not consistently delivered to patients. The organizational culture and processes that can increase the effective delivery of evidence-based falls prevention are discussed, alongside learning from quality improvement projects. Systematic learning from reported falls and essential care after an inpatient fall are also explored.

By:Bowden, Victoria;Bradas, Cheryl;McNett, MollyIn:Journal of Nursing Management, May2019, volume 27, issue 4, pages 833-839 (7p)CINAHL
Aim: To describe nurse‐specific and patient risk factors present at the time of a patient fall on medical surgical units within an academic public health care system. Background: The incidence of falls can be devastating for hospitalized patients and their families. Few studies have investigated how patient and nurse‐specific factors can decrease the occurrence of falls in hospitals. Method: In this retrospective cohort study, data were gathered on all patients who experienced a fall during January 2012 to December 2013. Results: Falls were reduced dramatically when the number of nurses on the unit increased to five or six. Patient falls occurred most often when either the least experienced or most experienced nursing staff were providing care. Conclusion: Patient falls in hospitals can be influenced not only by patient‐specific factors, but also by nurse staffing and experience level. Implications for nursing management: Findings from this study highlight factors which may contribute to hospital‐based falls prevention initiatives and are amenable to nursing management decisions.

Tools for Do patients with severe poststroke communication difficulties have a higher incidence of falls during inpatient rehabilitation? A retrospective cohort study.

Do patients with severe poststroke communication difficulties have a higher incidence of falls during inpatient rehabilitation? A retrospective cohort study.
By:Sullivan, Rebecca;Harding, KatherineIn:Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, May2019, volume 26, issue 4, pages 288-293 (6p)CINAHL
Background: Falls in hospital are common and serious complications of stroke. Associations have been found between communication disorders and increased rates of falls, but have received relatively little consideration as a risk factor for falls among stroke survivors. Objectives: To investigate whether there is an association between severe communication impairment and falls among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation after stroke. Methods: A retrospective audit of 149 records of consecutive patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility after stroke over a two-year period was conducted. The relationship between falls and severe communication impairment was explored using (1) direct comparison of falls in patients with and without functional communication for the inpatient ward environment and (2) multivariate logistic regression to examine factors that may predict falls, including presence or absence of functional communication. In each analysis, falls were examined both as a binary outcome (fall or no fall), and the rate of falls per day. Results: The 32 patients in the sample (21.7%) who were unable to communicate their basic needs were almost twice as likely to fall in hospital as those with functional communication (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.24). Several commonly assessed factors were not significant predictors of falls (including falls history, polypharmacy, and cognitive impairment) in this population. Lack of functional communication was the strongest independent predictor of falls rate. Conclusions: Findings suggest that severe communication disorders may be under recognized as a falls risk factor after stroke.

Longitudinal Association of Registered Nurse National Nursing Specialty Certification and Patient Falls in Acute Care Hospitals.
By:Boyle, Diane K.;Cramer, Emily;Potter, Catima;+1 moreIn:Nursing Research, Jul/Aug2015, volume 64, issue 4, pages 291-299 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Researchers have studied inpatient falls in relation to aspects of nurse staffing, focusing primarily on staffing levels and proportion of nursing care hours provided by registered nurses (RNs). Less attention has been paid to other nursing characteristics, such as RN national nursing specialty certification. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship over time between changes in RN national nursing specialty certification rates and changes in total patient fall rates at the patient care unit level. Methods: We used longitudinal data with standardized variable definitions across sites from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators. The sample consisted of 7,583 units in 903 hospitals. Relationships over time were examined using multilevel (units nested in hospitals) latent growth curve modeling. Results: The model indices indicated a good fit of the data to the model. At the unit level, there was a small statistically significant inverse relationship (r= -.08, p= .04) between RN national nursing specialty certification rates and total fall rates; increases in specialty certification rates over time tended to be associated with improvements in total fall rates over time. Discussion: Our findings may be supportive of promoting national nursing specialty certification as a means of improving patient safety. Future study recommendations are (a) modeling organizational leadership, culture, and climate as mediating variables between national specialty certification rates and patient outcomes and (b) investigating the association of patient safety and specific national nursing specialty certifications which test plans include patient safety, quality improvement, and diffusion of innovation methods in their certifying examinations.

Tools for Outcome of in-patient falls in hospitals with 100% single rooms and multi-bedded wards.

Outcome of in-patient falls in hospitals with 100% single rooms and multi-bedded wards.
By:SINGH, INDERPAL;OKEKE, JUSTIN;EDWARDS, CHRISIn:Age & Ageing, Nov2015, volume 44, issue 6, pages 1032-1035 (4p)CINAHL
Background: falls in hospital account for almost two-fifths of the patient safety incidents reported to the National Reporting and Learning System in UK. Studies have suggested an increased incidence of falls in single-bedded hospitals. Objective: to compare the outcome of in-patient falls occurring in units with 100% single rooms (SRs) and multi-bedded wards (M-BWs). Sampling design and methods: an observational study. Retrospective standard incident reporting data (DATIX) on in-patient falls and associated injury were obtained from both sites over 18 months each. There was no change in demographics, size and characteristics of population except change in the geography of new hospitals. Results: the total number of in-patient fall incidents reported over the 3 years was 1,749. The mean age of patients on M-BW and SR sites was 81.0 ± 2.4 (51.3% females) and 80.3 ± 10.3 (50.7% females), respectively. The mean incidence of falls/1,000 patient-bed days on M-BW and SR sites was 5.44 ± 4.76 and 15.82 ± 19.56, respectively (P< 0.01). Overall fracture incidence/ 1,000 patient-bed days on M-BW and SR sites was 0.07 ± 0.48 and 0.36 ± 1.52 (P< 0.01), respectively. The hip fracture incidence/1,000 patient-bed days on M-BW and SR sites was 0.04 ± 0.38 and 0.15 ± 1.00 (P < 0.01), respectively. One-year mortality from the date of first incident fall was lower in M-BWs (41.1%) compared with SRs (47.1%), but this is not significant (P = 0.12). Conclusion: this observational study shows a significantly increased incidence of falls and fracture in a hospital design with SRs compared with a multi-bedded facility. Consideration should be given to increased incidence of falls and falls-related injury in SRs when deciding on the percentage of single-room provision in new hospitals to admit frail older adults.

Tools for Using gravitational potential energy to assess the risk of falls from bed.

Using gravitational potential energy to assess the risk of falls from bed.
By:Martindale, DeborahIn:Nursing Times, Feb2022, volume 118, issue 2, pages 36-39 (4p)CINAHL
In the UK, falls in hospital are the most commonly reported patient safety incident. Risk is multifactorial and increases with age, some medications, and conditions such as delirium and dementia. Falls prevention should include a personalised assessment and discussions with patients, supported by consistent use of numerical data and a mix of word and picture formats. Any decision made to prevent a fall should be in the patient’s best interests and least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms. Gravitational potential energy is one way of showing the increased risk of harm from falls from a bed with increasing height. This can be combined with popliteal height to determine the best height that is least restrictive for patients and allows them to move safely out of bed.

ang e., mordiffi s.z. & wong h.b. (2011) Evaluating the use of a targeted multiple intervention strategy in reducing patient falls in an acute care hospital: a randomized controlled trial. Journal of Advanced Nursing 67(9), 1984-1992. Abstract Aim. This article is a report of a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a targeted multiple intervention strategy in reducing the number of patient falls in an acute care hospital. Background. Prevention of patient falls remains a challenge that has eluded healthcare institutions. The effectiveness of targeted multiple fall prevention interventions in reducing the incidences of falling has not been established. Methods. Patients who scored 5 and above on the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model, a fall assessment tool, were recruited in 2006. Patients who were randomized to the intervention group received targeted multiple interventions. Both the research groups received the standard fall prevention interventions from the ward nurses. The rates of fall incidences for both groups were reported with 95% CI, calculated using Wilson method and compared using the Chi-square test. The relative risk was estimated and 95% CI was calculated using the methods described by Armitage and Berry. The times to first fall events were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio was reported at 95% CI and the comparison was made using the log-rank test. Results. There were 912 and 910 participants in the control and intervention groups, respectively. The fall incidence rates were 1·5% (95% CI: 0·9-2·6) and 0·4% (95% CI: 0·2-1·1) in the control and intervention groups, respectively. The relative risk estimate of 0·29 (95% CI: 0·1-0·87) favours the intervention group. Conclusion. This study showed that targeted multiple interventions were effective in reducing the incidences of falls in patients in the acute care setting.

Tools for Fall Prevention Conceptual Framework.

Fall Prevention Conceptual Framework.
By:Abraham, SamIn:Health Care Manager, Oct-Dec2020, volume 39, issue 4, pages 144-149 (6p)CINAHL
Falls can have lasting psychological and physical consequences, particularly fractures and slowhealing processes, and patients may also lose confidence in walking. Injuries from falls lead to functional decline, institutionalization, higher health care costs, and decreased quality of life. The process related to the problem of patient falls in the hospital, using the nursing model developed by the theorist, Ida Jean Orlando, is explained in this article. The useful tool that provides guidance tomarketers in this endeavor is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. During acute illness, individuals are greatly in need of satisfying their physiological needs. If these needs are not met, patients leave the hospital lacking a positive experience. Initial fall risk assessment is critical to plan intervention and individualize care plan. Interventions depend on the severity of fall risk factors.

Context: Falls cause injury and death for persons of all ages, but risk of falls increases markedly with age. Hospitalization further increases risk, yet no evidence exists to support short-stay hospital-based fall prevention strategies to reduce patient falls.Objective: To investigate whether a fall prevention tool kit (FPTK) using health information technology (HIT) decreases patient falls in hospitals.Design, Setting, and Patients: Cluster randomized study conducted January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2009, comparing patient fall rates in 4 urban US hospitals in units that received usual care (4 units and 5104 patients) or the intervention (4 units and 5160 patients).Intervention: The FPTK integrated existing communication and workflow patterns into the HIT application. Based on a valid fall risk assessment scale completed by a nurse, the FPTK software tailored fall prevention interventions to address patients' specific determinants of fall risk. The FPTK produced bed posters composed of brief text with an accompanying icon, patient education handouts, and plans of care, all communicating patient-specific alerts to key stakeholders.Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was patient falls per 1000 patient-days adjusted for site and patient care unit. A secondary outcome was fall-related injuries.Results: During the 6-month intervention period, the number of patients with falls differed between control (n = 87) and intervention (n = 67) units (P=.02). Site-adjusted fall rates were significantly higher in control units (4.18 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.45-5.06] per 1000 patient-days) than in intervention units (3.15 [95% CI, 2.54-3.90] per 1000 patient-days; P = .04). The FPTK was found to be particularly effective with patients aged 65 years or older (adjusted rate difference, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.61-3.56] per 1000 patient-days; P = .003). No significant effect was noted in fall-related injuries.Conclusion: The use of a fall prevention tool kit in hospital units compared with usual care significantly reduced rate of falls.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00675935.

Tools for Nurses' solutions to prevent inpatient falls in hospital patient rooms.

Nurses' solutions to prevent inpatient falls in hospital patient rooms.
By:Tzeng H;Yin CIn:Nursing Economic$, May/Jun2008, volume 26, issue 3, pages 179-187 (9p)CINAHL
Patient fall rates are perceived as the indicator that could be most improved through nurse-led safety strategies or interventions. A safety-driven design with a goal to prevent inpatient fall-related injuries should be a hospital design principle. In this qualitative study, researchers used inductive and deductive methods to understand the clinically accessible solutions to minimize the extrinsic risk factors of inpatient falls. The findings from the nurse interviews were compared with the intervention strategies toward the five primary root causes of fatal falls as suggested by the Joint Commission (2005b). Twenty-four solutions were identified from the nurse interview transcriptions: five were related to the dimension of inadequate caregiver communication, none was associated with the dimension of inadequate staff orientation and training, three were related to inadequate assessment and reassessment, 15 were associated with unsafe care environment, and one was related to inadequate care planning and provision.

Tools for Falls in English and Welsh hospitals: a national observational study based on retrospective analysis of 12 months of patient safety incident reports.

Falls in English and Welsh hospitals: a national observational study based on retrospective analysis of 12 months of patient safety incident reports.
By:Healey F;Scobie S;Oliver D;+3 moreIn:Quality & Safety in Health Care, Dec2008, volume 17, issue 6, pages 424-430 (7p)CINAHL
INTRODUCTION: Falls in hospital inpatients are common, with reported rates ranging from 3 to 14 per 1,000 bed days. They cause physical and psychological harm, are associated with impaired rehabilitation, increased length of stay and excess cost, and lead to complaints and litigation, making them a crucial area for risk management. A National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) for patient safety incidents in England and Wales was utilised to examine frequency of falls in hospitals specialising in acute care, rehabilitation and mental health; related harm; timing; age and gender of patients who fell; and to draw general lessons from this which might inform fall-prevention strategies. METHODS: The NRLS database was searched retrospectively for slips, trips and falls occurring between 1 September 2005 and 31 August 2006. Organisations were classified as 'regularly reporting' if they returned reports at least monthly and with at least 100 patient safety incidents per month for acute trusts and 50 per month for community and mental health trusts. Falls rates were standardised as number of falls per 1,000 occupied bed days. Reporting hospitals used standardised categories for degree of harm from incidents, and injury rates were calculated as the percentage of injuries by severity per fall. Key word searches combined with free text scrutiny were conducted to identify specific injuries. Specific falls rates for time of day, gender and age were also compared, with age and gender adjusted for bed occupancy rates from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. Most data were used descriptively, though 95% confidence intervals were used to facilitate comparisons between groups and where samples are generalised to the data set as a whole. RESULTS: Reports of 206,350 falls were received from a total of 472 organisations. Falls incidents accounted for 32.3% of all reported patient safety incidents. 152,069 (73.7%) reports were from acute hospitals, 28,198 (13.7%) from community hospitals, and 26,083 (12.6%) from mental health units. Only 102 of these could be classified as 'regularly reporting' organisations, and in these the mean standardised rates of falls per 1,000 bed days were 4.8 in acute hospitals, 2.1 in mental health units and 8.4 in community hospitals. 133,417 falls (64.7%) resulted in 'no harm,' 64,144 (31.1%) in 'low harm,' 7,506 (3.6%) in 'moderate harm,' and 1230 (0.6%) in 'severe harm,' with 26 reported deaths. The proportions of falls resulting in some degree of harm varied significantly across the care settings: mental health units (44.5%; 95% CI 43.9 to 45.1), community hospitals (37.0%; 95% CI 36.4 to 37.6) and acute hospitals (33.4%; 95% CI 33.2 to 33.7). Patients aged 85-89 years had a higher-than-expected likelihood of falling relative to bed days. Males accounted for 50.8% (95% CI 50.5 to 51.1) of falls and females 49.2% (95% CI 48.9 to 49.5). (Occupied bed days were 45.5% male and 54.4% female.) The proportion of falls varied considerably with time, with a peak occurring between 10:00 and 11:59. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the largest retrospective study of hospital falls incidents and draws on data from almost 500 institutions of varying types. It describes wide variations in falls recording and reporting, and in recorded falls rates between institutions of different types and between institutions of ostensibly similar case-mix. As falls are the commonest reported patient safety incident, there is a pressing need for improvements in local reporting, recording and focused analysis of incident data, and for these data to be used at local and national level better to inform and target falls prevention, as well as to explore the reasons for large apparent differences in falls rates between institutions.

Greeley and colleagues' systematic review highlighted the paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of sitters and alternatives to sitters in preventing falls among patients in acute care hospitals. The editorialist discusses the findings and argues that, for acute care hospitals to be truly effective at keeping patients safe from events, such as falls, we need to make the entire health system more age-friendly.

Abstract Background Falls are a major problem for patients and hospitals, resulting in death, disability and increased costs of healthcare. Objectives This study aimed to estimate the resource allocation across a partnership of large health services, in an attempt to understand the amount and variability of resource allocation to various falls prevention activities. Design A cross sectional survey using semi-structured interviews. Setting Six tertiary health services in Australia. Participants A collaboration of six health services, spanning twenty-eight hospitals, was formed to investigate falls prevention resource allocation. We interviewed 186 health service staff who were involved in falls prevention activities, such as projects, audits and risk management, clinical and operational managers responsible for falls prevention resource allocation and clinical staff on targeted acute, subacute and mental health wards. Methods This study used a mixed methods, cross sectional, observational design. To collect data, we used key informant interviews with a purposive and snowball sampled group of people working in the included health services. During interviews, study participants were asked where and how falls prevention resources and equipment were utilised and to estimate the time allocated to performing falls prevention activities. The opportunity cost of each activity was estimated. All costs were reported in Australian dollars. Results We estimate the annual opportunity cost of health service attempts to prevent in-hospital falls across the six health services to be AU$46,478,014. If we extrapolate this to a national level, health services would be consuming AU$590 million per year in resources trying to prevent falls in hospital. The areas of greatest resource consumption were physiotherapy (18%), continuous patient observers (14%), falls assessments (12%) and screens (8%), and falls prevention alarms (11%). Falls prevention alarms and falls risk assessment screening tools were also used only for falls prevention, and are potentially ineffective falls prevention strategies. Conclusions Health services are investing considerable amounts of resource in attempting to prevent falls. However much of this resource is consumed in activities with weak or little evidence of effectiveness. Health services may be better served by considering tighter targeting, reduction or disinvestment in this area. This may release time and resources which could be used to provide interventions with a stronger evidence base, such as patient education using a structured patient education program or in other areas of practice where evidence of benefit exist.

Tools for Use of routinely collected data in reporting falls in hospitals in a local health district in New South Wales, Australia.

Use of routinely collected data in reporting falls in hospitals in a local health district in New South Wales, Australia.
By:Lieu Thi Thuy Trinh;Achat, Helen;Assareh, HassanIn:Health Information Management Journal, Jan2017, volume 46, issue 1, pages 15-22 (8p)CINAHL
Objective: To examine the quality of the two routinely collected sets of data, the Incident Information Management System (IIMS) and the health information exchange (HIE) in hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Method: IIMS records indicating a fall and its location were examined. HIE data were examined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-AM codes W00-W19 and an indicator, 'onset of the condition' for falls in hospital. If onset of the condition was not recorded, ICD-10-AM code for place of occurrence (Y92.22 = Health service area) immediately following ICD-10-AM code for the fall was used. Comprehensive criteria were applied to exclude records of earlier documented falls. IIMS and HIE data were linked. Characteristics of falls that were recorded in one data set but not in the other were determined. Results: Between January 2010 and December 2014, 8647 falls in hospitals were recorded in IIMS, 2169 were recorded in HIE and 9338 were recorded in either data set (rate of 3.2 falls per 1000 bed days). IIMS captured 93% and HIE captured 23% of these falls. Of the falls recorded in HIE, 677 (31%) were not recorded in IIMS. These were more likely to be subsequent falls, by patients who were female, younger than 65 years, who underwent a non-allied health procedure or had length of stay less than 1 week. Conclusions: IIMS captured the vast majority of falls in hospitals but failed to report one-third of falls recorded in HIE.

Tools for Prevention of falls in hospital.

Prevention of falls in hospital.
By:Morris, Rob;O'Riordan, ShelaghIn:Clinical Medicine, Aug2017, volume 17, issue 4, pages 360-362 (3p)CINAHL
Falls among inpatients are the most frequently reported safety incident in NHS hospitals. 30-50% of falls result in some physical injury and fractures occur in 1-3%. No fall is harmless, with psychological sequelae leading to lost confi dence, delays in functional recovery and prolonged hospitalisation. Yet falls are not true accidents and there is evidence that a coordinated multidisciplinary clinical team approach can reduce their incidence. Identifi cation of multiple underlying risk factors coupled with clear interventions to ameliorate the impact of each has been shown to reduce the incidence of inpatient falls by 20-30%. The implementation of complex multiprofessional interventions is challenging and successful schemes seek to nurture a culture of vigilant safety consciousness in all staff at the clinical interface. Strong leadership and organisational oversight help to combine this cultural evolution with relevant evidence and rigorous measurement of performance in order to improve patient safety. The results of national audit suggest that NHS acute hospitals could do more to reduce the incidence of falls among inpatients.

RN Workgroup Job Satisfaction and Patient Falls in Acute Care Hospital Units.
By:JiSun Choi;Boyle, Diane K.In:Journal of Nursing Administration (JONA), Nov2013, volume 43, issue 11, pages 586-591 (6p)CINAHL
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between registered nurse (RN) workgroup job satisfaction and patient falls on 4 types of acute care hospital units. BACKGROUND: Although a link has been found between nurse job satisfaction and quality of patient care, little research has been conducted to examine the effect of RN job satisfaction on patient clinical outcomes in acute care hospitals. METHODS: Random-intercept negative binomial regression analyses were performed using 2009 unit- level data from 2,763 units in 576 National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators hospitals. RESULTS: Controlling for unit (nurse staffing, RN education, and RN unit tenure) and hospital (MagnetÂ® status, hospital size, and teaching status) characteristics, RN workgroup job satisfaction was inversely associated with patient falls (incident rate ratio, 0.941,95% confidence interval, 0.911-0.972). CONCLUSIONS: Higher RN workgroup job satisfaction is significantly related to fewer patient falls on acute care hospital units.

Tools for Low-impact (compliant) flooring and staff injuries.

Low-impact (compliant) flooring and staff injuries.
By:Hanger, H. C.;Wilkinson, Tim J.In:Disability & Rehabilitation, Apr2022, volume 44, issue 7, pages 1136-1140 (5p)CINAHL
Low impact flooring (LIF) has shown potential for reducing fall-related injuries for older people in residential care or hospital environments. However, the increased rolling resistance when moving equipment on these floors has raised concerns that staff injuries may increase. LIF was trialled on one Older Persons Health ward for 2.5 years. Reported staff injuries were monitored during and following the trial. Numbers of staff injured on the LIF ward were compared with three other similar and adjacent OPH wards without LIF for the duration of the trial ('concurrent control' evaluation). At the trial conclusion the LIF ward moved to a different hospital that had standard flooring. This enabled a further 'during and after' evaluation where numbers of staff injured from the LIF ward during the trial were compared with those reported afterwards by the same ward staff without LIF. There was no difference in the numbers of staff injured in the LIF ward compared with the concurrent control wards (28 LIF vs 30 control; p = 0.44). The number of staff with injuries in the LIF ward also did not significantly alter when those staff moved to a new ward without LIF (45 after vs 28 before; p = 0.11). There was no change in the numbers of staff with injuries during the LIF trial in an Older Persons Health ward. This small study suggests LIF appears safe for both patients and staff. Falls in hospital are common with patient injuries occurring in approximately 20-30% of falls. Low impact (compliant) flooring may reduce fall-related injuries in hospitals and residential care. Low impact flooring has an increased rolling resistance, which has the potential to increase staff injuries when moving equipment. This study found no change in the number of staff injured during a low impact flooring trial providing some reassurance that these floors are safe for staff.

The Hendrich II Fall Risk Model™ (Hendrich II) is used to determine patient fall risks. However, the WilsonSims Fall Risk Assessment Tool (WSFRAT) is more specific to psychiatric patients. The current study tested the Hendrich II and WSFRAT simultaneously to determine which tool was the most predictive for patient falls in a psychiatric population. Fall risk assessments using the Hendrich II and WSFRAT tools were completed through discharge. Fall risk assessment scores, medications, and falls data were documented. Fifty patients who met eligibility criteria generated 319 observations; of the 50 patients, two (4%) experienced falls. Sensitivity was 100% for the Hendrich II and WSFRAT, with all patients properly categorized as high risk for falling. Both assessments had similar specificity (Hendrich II = 67.8%; WSFRAT = 63.1%). Both tools have similar specificity; thus, additional research is warranted. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 52(12), 30-35.]

By:Donoghue J;Graham J;Gibbs J;+1 moreIn:Australian Health Review, 2003, volume 26, issue 3, pages 79-87 (9p)CINAHL
Falls are a significant burden on the Australian healthcare budget and can result in loss of personal independence, injury or death. A sustained high rate of inpatient falls at St George Hospital has made it imperative for nurses to identify those patients at highest risk in order to implement preventive interventions. Ninety-one inpatients fell over a ten-week period, with a total of 118 falls. Our study examined the prevalence of 'intrinsic high risk' characteristics identified in the literature in people who fell during hospitalisation. These results will be reported elsewhere. Extrinsic environmental factors contributing to falls were also identified, including time of fall, activity at time of fall and location of fall. This paper describes and discusses the study findings related to extrinsic risk factors.

Preventing Falls in the Surgical Setting by Implementing a Fall Prevention Bundle...American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, 42nd National Conference, April 28 - May 1, 2023, Denver, Colorado.
By:Kelley, Rebecca J.;Gutchell, Veronica;O'Neill, KristineIn:Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing, Aug2023, volume 38, issue 4, page e27CINAHL
A quality improvement (QI) project was implemented to prevent perioperative patient falls. Perioperative adult patients are at a high risk of falls due to gait and balance disturbances, postoperative polypharmacy, intravascular volume status changes, and unfamiliarity with the perioperative environment. There were eight preventable falls during 2020 in adult perioperative patients at an urban hospital despite their current fall prevention strategies. The purpose of this QI project was to evaluate a fall prevention bundle, which included a fall safety agreement, patient falls education, and the Fall Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety tool (Fall T.I.P.S.). This QI project was implemented in three surgical units over 16 weeks from August to December 2021. Ninety-one registered nurses in Preop/PACU/Phase II recovery, 14 patient care technicians, six transporters, nine patient service representatives, and two administrative assistants were trained on the fall prevention bundle. Preop nurses gave all adult surgical patients the Fall Safety Agreement to review and sign, and implemented the Fall T.I.P.S. tool if the adult surgical patient has a Morse Fall Scale (MFS) score ≥51. Weekly data were collected over 16 weeks, including RN adherence to implementing and documenting interventions, and fall rates. By the end of the project, the average percentage of staff adherence with documentation of interventions was 80.8%. The average percentage of patients who received education and signed the fall safety agreement was 92%. The implementation rate of the Fall T.I.P.S. tool for patients with a MFS ≥51 was an average of 67.1%. The average number of patients with MFS ≥51 was 3.62 patients per day. During project implementation, there were no falls reported. The fall safety agreement provides standardized fall education for patients and can be modified for any setting. The Fall T.I.P.S. tool is an effective communication tool used to notify staff of a patient's fall risk and individualized interventions. There is limited research for fall prevention in perioperative patients. This QI project utilized a fall safety agreement, designed for perioperative patients, and the Fall T.I.P.S. tool to prevent falls. These interventions were simple to implement and had a positive impact on reducing patient falls in the perioperative setting.

Objective: To identify factors in the nursing work domain that contribute to the problem of inpatient falls, aside from patient risk, using cognitive work analysis.Design: A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were used to identify work constraints imposed on nurses, which may underlie patient falls.Measurements: Data collection was done on a neurology unit staffed by 27 registered nurses and utilized field observations, focus groups, time-motion studies and written surveys (AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Culture, NASA-TLX, and custom Nursing Knowledge of Fall Prevention Subscale).Results: Four major constraints were identified that inhibit nurses' ability to prevent patient falls. All constraints relate to work processes and the physical work environment, opposed to safety culture or nursing knowledge, as currently emphasized. The constraints were: cognitive 'head data', temporal workload, inconsistencies in written and verbal transfer of patient data, and limitations in the physical environment. To deal with these constraints, the nurses tend to employ four workarounds: written and mental chunking schemas, bed alarms, informal querying of the previous care nurse, and informal video and audio surveillance. These workarounds reflect systemic design flaws and may only be minimally effective in decreasing risk to patients.Conclusion: Cognitive engineering techniques helped identify seemingly hidden constraints in the work domain that impact the problem of patient falls. System redesign strategies aimed at improving work processes and environmental limitations hold promise for decreasing the incidence of falls in inpatient nursing units.

This study looked at associations of tranquilliser use and falls risk in a hospital population of confused and nonconfused patients. In a prospective observational study in a rehabilitation hospital for elderly patients, we followed 1025 consecutive patients. The number of fallers, recurrent fallers and total falls was recorded. Confused patients (p < 0.0001) and patients on tranquillisers (p = 0.001) were significantly more likely to fall than nonconfused patients and patients off tranquillisers. Confused patients on tranquillisers were significantly more likely to have recurrent falls (p ¼ 0.026) when compared with confused patients off tranquillisers. The risk was apparent from admission, persisting throughout the first 30 days of stay. This was not noted for nonconfused patients. We identified a stratification of risk for falls with nonsignificant trends for confused and nonconfused patients on tranquillisers to be fallers and to have more falls compared with patients off tranquillisers. These data are associational and do not necessarily imply causality. There is however no evidence to recommend the routine withdrawal of tranquillisers from all patients. Any future research needs to include confused patients.

Managing Patient Falls in Psychiatric Inpatient Units: Part 2.
By:Abraham, SamIn:Health Care Manager, Apr-Jun2016, volume 35, issue 2, pages 121-133 (13p)CINAHL
Patient falls in the hospital psychiatric inpatient units are more frequent than in the medical-surgical units. The purpose of this study was to explore psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the factors that contribute to patient falls in the State of Michigan. A quantitative online questionnaire was sent to the directors of psychiatric units in Michigan. Two research questions (RQs) guided the study: (a) What are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible intrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units, and (b) what are psychiatric unit directors' perceptions of the possible extrinsic factors that contribute to patient falls in the psychiatric inpatient units? In comparing the results, 6 of the 7 factors with the highest mean levels of agreement were intrinsic factors. In the current study, patient gait (mean, 4.65) ranked first, history of falls (mean, 4.52) second, and multiple medications (mean, 4.50) third as fall-risk factors. The need for the involvement of the team members (mean, 4.55) in preventing falls was the most highly rated factor among the extrinsic factors. Educating unit team members in assisting with fall prevention is a critical consideration for leaders.

This study aims to assess the prevalence of falls, understand their consequences, identify causes and analyze intervention strategies to prevent them. This is a descriptive longitudinal study, from 2007 to 2009, in which nurses recorded patients' falls in a medicine ward, using a scale developed for this end. Most falls occurred with partially dependent patients, with a mean age ranging from 64 to 74 years. The bedroom was, in all of these years, the place where most of these falls occurred. Although most falls did not have consequences, they were observed in 36% of the cases. The number of falls increased throughout the years of the study. There was also a difference in the percentage of occurrences in the afternoon and night shifts (39% in 2007, 57% in 2008 and 64% in 2009). The identification of obstacles to referral and how to overcome them are analyzed here.

Hospital Costs and Reimbursement Model for a Geriatric Emergency Department.
By:Southerland, Lauren T.;Savage, Elizabeth L.;Muska Duff, Katrina;+6 moreIn:Academic Emergency Medicine, Oct2020, volume 27, issue 10, pages 1051-1058 (8p)CINAHL
Objectives: The American College of Emergency Physicians' geriatric emergency department (GED) guidelines recommend additional staff and geriatric equipment, which may not be financially feasible for every ED. Data from an accredited Level 1 GED was used to report equipment costs and to develop a business model for financial sustainability of a GED. Methods: Staff salaries including the cost of fringe benefits were obtained from a Midwestern hospital with an academic ED of 80,000 annual visits. Reimbursement assumptions included 100% Medicare/Medicaid insurance payor and 8‐hour workdays with 4.5 weeks of leave annually. Equipment costs from hospital invoices were collated. Operational and patient safety metrics were compared before and after the GED. Results: A geriatric nurse practitioner in the ED is financially self‐sustaining at 7.1 consultations, a pharmacist is self‐sustaining at 7.7 medication reconciliation consultations, and physical and occupational therapist evaluations are self‐sustaining at 5.7 and 4.6 consults per workday, respectively. Total annual equipment costs for mobility aids, delirium aids, sensory aids, and personal care items for the GED was $4,513. Comparing the 2 years before and after, in regard to operational metrics the proportions of patients with lengths of stay > 8 hours and patients placed in observation did not change. In regard to patient safety, the rate of falls decreased from 0.60/1,000 patient visits to 0.42/1,000 in the ED observation unit and 0.42/1,000 to 0.36/1,000 in the ED. ED recidivism at 7 and 30 days did not change. Estimated cost savings from the reduction in falls was $80,328. Conclusion: The additional equipment and personnel costs for comprehensive geriatric assessment in the ED are potentially financially justified by revenue generation and improvements in patient safety measures. A geriatric ED was associated with a decrease in patient falls in the ED but did not decrease admissions or ED recidivism.

Risk factors and risk assessment tools for falls in hospital in-patients: a systematic review.
By:Oliver D;Daly F;Martin FC;+1 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Mar2004, volume 33, issue 2, pages 122-130 (9p)CINAHL
OBJECTIVE: To identify all published papers on risk factors and risk assessment tools for falls in hospital inpatients. To identify clinical risk assessment tools or individual clinical risk factors predictive of falls, with the ultimate aim of informing the design of effective fall prevention strategies. DESIGN: Systematic literature review (Cochrane methodology). Independent assessment of quality against agreed criteria. Calculation of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors and of sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value for risk assessment tools (with odds ratios and confidence intervals), where published data sufficient. RESULTS: 28 papers on risk factors were identified, with 15 excluded from further analysis. Despite the identification of 47 papers purporting to describe falls risk assessment tools, only six papers were identified where risk assessment tools had been subjected to prospective validation, and only two where validation had been performed in two or more patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of significant falls risk factors emerged consistently, despite the heterogeneity of settings namely gait instability, agitated confusion, urinary incontinence/frequency, falls history and prescription of 'culprit' drugs (especially sedative/hypnotics). Simple risk assessment tools constructed of similar variables have been shown to predict falls with sensitivity and specificity in excess of 70%, although validation in a variety of settings and in routine clinical use is lacking. Effective falls interventions in this population may require the use of better-validated risk assessment tools, or alternatively, attention to common reversible falls risk factors in all patients.

Tools for Determinants of hospital fall rate trajectory groups: A longitudinal assessment of nurse staffing and organizational characteristics.

Determinants of hospital fall rate trajectory groups: A longitudinal assessment of nurse staffing and organizational characteristics.
By:Everhart, Damian;Schumacher, Jessica R.;Duncan, R. Paul;+3 moreIn:Health Care Management Review, Oct-Dec2014, volume 39, issue 4, pages 352-360 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Patient falls in acute care hospitals represent a significant patient safety concern. Although cross-sectional studies have shown that fall rates vary widely between acute care hospitals, it is not clear whether hospital fall rates remain consistent over time. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether hospitals can be categorized into fall rate trajectory groups over time and to identify nurse staffing and hospital characteristics associated with hospital fall rate trajectory groups. Methodology/Approach: We conducted a 54-month (July 2006-December 2010) longitudinal study of U.S. acute care general hospitals participating in the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators® (2007). We used latent class growth modeling to categorize hospitals into groups based on their long-term fall rates. Nurse staffing and hospital characteristics associated with membership in the highest hospital fall rate group were identified using logistic regression. Findings: A sample of 1,529 hospitals (mean fall rate of 3.65 per 1,000 patient days) contributed data to the analysis. Latent class growth modeling findings classified hospital into three groups based on fall rate trajectories: consistently high (mean fall rate of 4.96 per 1,000 patient days), consistently medium (mean fall rate of 3.63 per 1,000 patient days), and consistently low (mean fall rate of 2.50 per 1,000 patient days). Hospitals with higher total nurse staffing (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [Cl] [0.85, 0.99]), Magnet status (OR = 0.49, 95% Cl [0.35, 0.70]), and bed size greater than 300 beds (OR = 0.70, 95% Cl [0.51, 0.94]) were significantly less likely to be categorized in the 'consistently high' fall rate group. Practice Implications: Over this 54-month period, hospitals were categorized into three groups based on long-term fall rates. Hospital-level factors differed among these three groups. This suggests that there may be hospitals in which 'best practices' for fall prevention might be identified. In addition, administrators may be able to reduce fall rates by maintaining greater nurse staffing ratios as well as fostering an environment consistent with that of Magnet hospitals.

Tools for Fall prevention in our healthiest patients: Assessing risk and preventing injury for moms and babies.

Fall prevention in our healthiest patients: Assessing risk and preventing injury for moms and babies.
By:Gaffey, Ann D.In:Journal of Healthcare Risk Management, Jan2015, volume 34, issue 3, pages 37-40 (4p)CINAHL
Attention is needed in preventing patient falls in newborns and in obstetric units of hospitals. The majority of prenatal, postpartum, and newborn falls are preventable. Little effort has been made to address fall risk during the prenatal period, during labor, and after delivery in the postpartum period for moms and babies. Risk factors for falls in these populations have been identified, and targeted risk assessments and fall prevention interventions have been developed to eliminate these falls. Evidence demonstrates success in reducing falls with a variety of low‐cost but high‐return initiatives, comprising prenatal education, patient and family engagement, implementation of unique fall risk assessment tools, postpartum mobility assessments, and changes in patient rounding frequency.

Tools for Characteristics of falls in hospitalized patients.

Characteristics of falls in hospitalized patients.
By:Kerzman H;Chetrit A;Brin L;+1 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (Wiley-Blackwell), Jul2004, volume 47, issue 2, pages 223-229 (7p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: The high incidence of patient falls in a hospital setting is a major concern in any health system. Research findings have reported the risk factors for these falls as age, gender, certain medications, mental status, chronic diseases and environmental factors. Falls may lead to fear, pain, slight or severe injuries, increase the duration of hospital stay, cause patient discomfort and affect quality of life. AIM: The aim of this paper is to report a study of the characteristics of patient falls during hospitalization in 1998 and compare them with those in the period 1978-1981. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a large, 2000-bed medical center in Israel. Reports of 711 fall incidents in 1998 were compared with 328 reports in 1978-1981. Information gathered included age, gender, department, shift, reasons, severity of injury, tests and treatment after injury. RESULTS: The rates of falls per 1000 admissions in psychiatric, elder care and rehabilitation departments in 1998 were statistically significantly higher than in the earlier period. Rates of 115, 91, 85, respectively, per 1000 admissions were reported in 1998 compared with 34, 9, 19, respectively, in the period 1978-1981. The percentage of reported falls in the younger age group (under 50) was higher in the later survey (1998), and a higher proportion occurred outside the patient's room. Most of the reported falls in 1998 occurred during the morning shift (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of falls could be an outcome of increased awareness. Nevertheless, the causes and place of falls differ for the two periods. Some of the reasons may be related to an intervention programme carried out after the first survey. The latest survey results will serve as an important basis for a further intervention programme in specific departments to ensure patient safety.

Tools for Nursing Unit Design, Nursing Staff Communication Networks, and Patient Falls: Are They Related?

Nursing Unit Design, Nursing Staff Communication Networks, and Patient Falls: Are They Related?
By:Brewer, Barbara B.;Carley, Kathleen M.;Benham-Hutchins, Marge;+2 moreIn:Health Environments Research & Design Journal (HERD) (Sage Publications, Ltd.), Oct2018, volume 11, issue 4, pages 82-94 (13p)CINAHL
Purpose: The purpose of this research is to (1) investigate the impact of nursing unit design on nursing staff communication patterns and, ultimately, on patient falls in acute care nursing units; and (2) evaluate whether differences in fall rates, if found, were associated with the nursing unit physical structure (shape) or size. Background: Nursing staff communication and nursing unit design are frequently linked to patient safety outcomes, yet little is known about the impact of specific nursing unit designs on nursing communication patterns that might affect patient falls. Method: An exploratory longitudinal correlational design was used to measure nursing unit communication structures using social network analysis techniques. Data were collected 4 times over a 7-month period. Floor plans were used to determine nursing unit design. Fall rates were provided by hospital coordinators. Results: An analysis of covariance controlling for hospitals resulted in a statistically significant interaction of unit shape and size (number of beds). The interaction occurred when medium- and large-sized racetrack-shaped units intersected with medium- and large-sized cross-shaped units. Conclusion: The results suggest that nursing unit design shape impacts nursing communication patterns, and the interaction of shape and size may impact patient falls. How those communication patterns affect patient falls should be considered when planning hospital construction of nursing care units.

Reduction in the prevalence of methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus in tissue and wound swab samples taken from outpatients attending a specialist diabetic foot clinic 2005–2021.
By:Moore, James;Gooday, Catherine;Soliman, Reham;+1 moreIn:Diabetic Medicine, Oct2023, volume 40, issue 10, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Aims: To assess annual change in prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from tissue and wound swab samples from foot ulcers (DFUs) in people with diabetes between 2005 and 2021. Methods: A retrospective analysis of everyone with MRSA positive wound or tissue swabs taken from our specialist multidisciplinary foot clinic between July 2005 and July 2021. Results: A total of 406 MRSA positive isolates from DFU swabs were identified from 185 individuals attending the foot clinic. There were 22 hospital‐acquired infections (HAIs) and 159 community‐acquired infections (CAIs). Fifty‐two per cent (n = 37) of these individuals from 2010 to 2021 (n = 71) had presence of at least three risk factors for MRSA. The total number of swabs sent was 6312 from 1916 individuals living with diabetes. Annual MRSA DFU prevalence peaked in 2008 at 14.6% (n = 38), decreased in 2013 to 5.2% (n = 20) and did not exceed 4% (n = 6) from 2015 to 2021. Hospital MRSA was lowest in 2021 (n = 211), a 76% fall from 2007 (n = 880). Incidence of MRSA HAI from 2015 to 2021 ranged from 5.4% (n = 14) in 2020 to 11.5% (n = 41) in 2018. Conclusions: Prevalence of MRSA in DFU infections treated as outpatients is decreasing in line with falls in hospital acquired blood‐borne infections and with overall hospital MRSA incidence. This is likely a reflection of the combination of interventions, including stringent antibiotic prescribing and decolonisation strategies. Reduction in prevalence should have positive impact on outcomes in people living with diabetes, reducing the complication of osteomyelitis and necessity for long‐term antibiotic administration.

Falls in hospital settings continue to challenge health care providers. Multifactorial interventions aim to reduce falls but rarely involve the patient as an active participant. A patient self-assessment of fall risk questionnaire was customized in the hospital's computer-based, television-equipped, interactive patient care system. Designed to engage patients in determining their risk for falling, the questionnaire is a reliable and valid means for patients and nurses to assess risk of falls.

Kinect sensors were placed in six hospital rooms in a step-down unit and data were continuously logged. Prior to implementation with patients, three researchers performed a total of 18 falls (walking and then falling down or falling from the bed) and 17 non-fall events (crouching down, stooping down to tie shoe laces, and lying on the floor). All falls and non-falls were correctly identified using automated algorithms to process Kinect sensor data. During the first 8 months of data collection, processing methods were perfected to manage data and provide a "rewind" method to view events that led to falls for post-fall quality improvement process analyses. Preliminary data from this feasibility study show that using the Microsoft Kinect sensors provides detection of falls, fall risks, and facilitates quality improvement after falls in real hospital environments unobtrusively, while taking into account patient privacy.

Tools for Fear of falling: association between the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, in-hospital falls and hospital length of stay.

Fear of falling: association between the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, in-hospital falls and hospital length of stay.
By:Gettens, Stephanie;Fulbrook, PaulIn:Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, Feb2015, volume 21, issue 1, pages 43-50 (8p)CINAHL
Rationale, aims and objectives Falls in hospital are costly and may impact psychologically on fallers causing them to avoid mobilization, thereby affecting recovery rate and hospital length of stay. The study aim was to investigate the relationships between fear of falling, falls risk, in-hospital falls and hospital length of stay. Method A convenience sample ( n = 141) of patients from a large tertiary hospital was recruited. Data were collected over 6 months using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale ( MFES) on ward admission, prior to discharge, and in the event of a fall. Results A third of the sample ( n = 44) was admitted to hospital following a fall. The majority (65%) was categorized as medium falls risk. Twenty-five participants sustained a total of 30 falls during their hospital admission of which 13 sustained a total of 15 falls on the study wards. The mean admission MFES score was 5.5, which increased to 6.1 on hospital discharge. Fallers scored significantly lower admission MFES scores than non-fallers ( P = 0.003). Receiver-operating curve analysis indicated that admission MFES score was a 'fair' predictor of sustaining a fall (area under curve = 0.71, P = 0.013). With a cut-off score of 5, admission MFES sensitivity was 77% and specificity was 55%. Study ward fallers had significantly longer hospital length of stay (49 days) than non-fallers (27 days; P = 0.037). Furthermore, regardless of whether the participant was a faller or not, significantly longer hospital stay was associated with an admission MFES score of less than 5. Conclusions An admission MFES score of less than 5 is an effective predictor of patient falls and is associated with a significantly longer hospital length of stay.

While falls on medical-surgical units are the focus of extensive research, falls on inpatient psychiatric units are an understudied critical event. The purposes of this study were to identify the variables associated with psychiatric patient falls and to use that information to assess risk and, therefore, prevent falls in this population. The psychiatric patient at risk for falling is described as a woman with a prior history of falls; less than 65 years of age; experiencing anxiety and agitation; and receiving a sedative, a tranquilizer, and a laxative. Additionally, this patient is more likely to fall in a community area.

Rationale, aims and objectives Acute inpatient falls are common and serious adverse events that lead to injury, prolonged hospitalization and increased cost of care. To determine the difference in total acute hospital care length of stay ( LOS) for patients with and without an in-hospital fall ( IHF), regardless of degree of harm. Methods This was a retrospective observational study at a 728-bed acute care teaching hospital. We used propensity scores to match 292 patients with 330 controls by case mix group, sex, Resource Intensity Weights and week of admission. We used two administrative databases: hospital fall incident reporting system and Discharge Abstract Database. We reviewed all IHF incidents for patients 18 years and older, admitted to inpatient acute care hospital units/programs between 1 November 2009 and 31 August 2011. Results The average LOS for IHF cases was 37.2 days [median 26.5 days; interquartile range ( IQR) 14, 54] and 25.7 days (median 13 days; IQR 5, 33) for matched control patients. Survival analysis results indicated that patients who did not have an IHF were 2.4 times (95% CI 2.1, 2.7; P < 0.001) more likely to be discharged earlier from acute care than patients who had an IHF. Conclusions Experiencing either an injurious or a non-injurious fall during an acute care hospitalization was associated with prolonged LOS.

The fall is considered a public health problem and one of the main events to be prevented in health institutions. This study aimed at identifying the incidence, the characteristics of the falls of adult patients hospitalized in clinical and surgical internment units (IUs) and in attendance in emergency services (ES), as well as the epidemiologic profile of these patients and the risk factors. This is a retrospective study of the fall cases of patients hospitalized in the period from January 1st, 2011, to June 30th, 2012. The data analysis was conducted by means of descriptive statistics. 185 events, of these 93 (5%) occurred in IUs, were analyzed. The incidence was 1,7 per 1.000 patients-daily in IUs and 2,6 per 1.000 admissions in ES. Most of them occurred at night (50,6%), in the patient's room (65,4%) and from their own heights (52,4%). Of the patients who fell, 90,8% had pre-determined risk for falls, with the age (≥65) as the main risk factor. From the resulting injuries, 82,6% showed mild damage = and 14 of these cases influenced in the increased length of hospital stay. The findings have contributed to a better understanding of falls in hospital environment, thereby helping in the planning and promotion of preventive actions to hospitalized patients.

Are sequential compression devices commonly associated with in-hospital falls? A myth-busters review using the patient safety net database.
By:Boelig, Matthew M.;Streiff, Michael B.;Hobson, Deborah B.;+3 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, 2011 Jun, volume 7, issue 2, pages 77-79 (3p)CINAHL
Objectives: Sequential compression devices (SCDs) help prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients; however, clinicians often decline to use this therapy because of a perceived increased risk for patient falls. There is limited information regarding the association between the use of SCDs and patient falls. In this study, we analyze if SCD use is a common risk factor for in-hospital falls. Methods: We used the Patient Safety Net event reporting system at our university-affiliated hospital to retrospectively quantify reports of SCD-related falls over a nearly 5-year period (July 1, 2004, through May 25, 2009). The primary outcome was to determine how often SCD-related falls occurred in relation to SCD patient days. Secondary aims of this study included an assessment of the severity of SCD-related falls, as well as potential risk factors for such falls. Results: Three thousand five hundred sixty-two total falls were reported during our study period, 16 of which (0.45%) were SCD-related falls. There were 0.063 SCD-related falls per 1000 SCD patient days or 1 fall for every 15,774 SCD patient days. The mean age of patients was 57.8 ± 14.4 years, 69% were male subjects, 81% were on a surgical ward, and 69% occurred while attempting to toilet. Only 2 of the SCD-related falls caused temporary harm that required intervention. Conclusions: Sequential compression device use is rarely associated with in-hospital patient falls, and SCD-related falls are not more harmful than other types of falls.

By:Johal KS;Boulton C;Moran CG;+3 moreIn:Injury, Feb2009, volume 40, issue 2, pages 201-204 (4p)CINAHL
Objectives: To compare the prevalence and characteristics of hip fractures sustained after inpatient falls (hospital subgroup) to those presenting with a fall in the community (control group). Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Participants: 5879 hip fractures occurred over an 8-year period, 327 of these took place after a fall as a hospital inpatient. Outcome Measures: Comparison of 30-day and 1 year mortality, co-morbidities, length of post-fracture hospital stay, specific complication rates and cognitive function between the hospital and control group. Other specific data on those falling in hospital was also collected. Results: There were significantly higher rates (p<0.001) of cerebrovascular, chronic obstructive airways and renal disease, diabetes, malignancy and polypharmacy in patients suffering falls in hospital. Mini-mental test scores (MTS) were also significantly reduced in this subgroup (p<0.001). 30-day and 1 year mortality rates were 9% and 26%, respectively in the control group and almost double this in the hospital subgroup, being 18% and 47%, respectively (30 days, 95% CI 2.00 (1.54-2.60): p<0.001; 1 year, 95% CI 2.04 (1.73-2.40): p<0.001). There was no statistical difference between post-operative complications or length of stay post-fracture. 55% of falls in hospital took place on medical/geriatric wards with an additional 14% occurring on psychiatric units. Discussion: Patients suffering hip fractures after falls in hospital are frailer with impaired cognitive function and have more co-morbidities than those suffering a fracture in the community. These patients have increased mortality, with almost 50% dead within 1 year of the fall. The majority of hip fractures after falls occur in medical or geriatric wards, but the highest risk group appears to be elderly patients on psychiatric wards. Therefore, falls risk assessment and falls prevention schemes in hospital elderly patients are of paramount importance.

Evaluation of the Morse Fall Scale: applicability in Chinese hospital populations.
By:Chow SKY;Lai CKY;Wong TKS;+4 moreIn:International Journal of Nursing Studies, May2007, volume 44, issue 4, pages 556-565 (10p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Patient falls have been identified as a significant health problem in the general hospital patient population. The Morse Fall Scale (MFS) is an individualized criterion-referenced assessment tool designed for measuring the likelihood of patient falls in hospitals. Despite the scale has demonstrated high validity and reliability in the previous researches, this study is to provide additional validity tests to determine the applicability in the Chinese hospital population. OBJECTIVES: To examine the predictive power of the MFS to predict patient falls. To conduct reliability tests on internal consistency, item analysis, inter-rater and test-retest reliability. DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: The medical and geriatric units of three rehabilitation hospitals in Hong Kong participated in the study. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 954 Chinese patients was recruited sequentially upon admission in the hospital ward units. They ranged in age from 17 to 100 years, with a mean of 70.2 years. METHODS: The patients were assessed for fall risk using the MFS on admission. Data was collected on the number of patients who fell rather than the number of falls. RESULTS: The scale had a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 83% when the cut-off point was determined at 45. The field test demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability with an ICC value of 0.97 (95%CI 0.94-0.98). Repeatability was high with an ICC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99). The evaluation revealed a low Cronbach's alpha coefficient and a low to moderate item-to-scale correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence collected in this study has shown both the positive and negative aspects of using the MFS in assessing the fall risk of Chinese patients during rehabilitation. The discriminative validity and internal consistency reliability provide researchers and clinicians with a major step in further developing or modifying the scale.

Tools for Predictors for falls among hospital inpatients with impaired mobility.

Predictors for falls among hospital inpatients with impaired mobility.
By:Vassallo M;Vignaraja R;Sharma JC;+7 moreIn:Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Jun2004, volume 97, issue 6, pages 266-269 (4p)CINAHL
Gait and balance disturbances have been shown to predispose to falls in hospital. We aimed to investigate the patient characteristics associated with an unsafe gait and to determine what features predispose to falling in this group of hospital inpatients. In a prospective open observational study we studied 825 patients admitted for rehabilitation following acute medical illness or a surgical procedure. The patient's gait was assessed with the 'get up and go' test and classified into one of four categories-normal; abnormal but safe with or without mobility aids; unsafe; or unable. 72.6% of patients were assessed as having an unsafe gait. The factors independently associated with an unsafe gait were confusion, abnormal lower limbs, hearing defects and the use of tranquillizers. Patients with an unsafe gait who fell were more likely than the non-fallers within the group to have had falls in the past (85.3% versus 73.8%) and to be confused (66.2% versus 34.1%). Patients with both these characteristics had a 37.5% chance of falling compared with 15.4% in patients with one and 11.2% in patients with none of these characteristics. The presence of confusion and a history of falls identifies those patients who are at greatest risk of falls. Such patients might be the focus of special efforts at falls prevention.

Tools for Effects of bed height on the biomechanics of hospital bed entry and egress.

Effects of bed height on the biomechanics of hospital bed entry and egress.
By:Merryweather, Andrew S.;Morse, Janice M.;Doig, Alexa K.;+3 moreIn:Work, 2015, volume 52, issue 3, pages 707-713 (7p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Although a significant proportion of patient falls in hospitals occur in the vicinity of the hospital bed, little is known about the contribution of bed height to fall risk. OBJECTIVE: To compare lower extremity joint torques and angles during hospital bed entry and egress at two bed heights. METHODS: Twelve adults (age > 55) were purposively selected and had variety of strength and mobility limitations. Biomechanical data for this pilot study were collected with three digital video cameras and processed to obtain estimates for joint torques and included angles. RESULTS: At the low bed height, hip torque for bed entry was significantly higher, and hip, knee, and ankle flexion angles were significantly smaller. The absence of significant differences in knee and ankle torques were the result of a compensation strategy that shifts the center of mass forward by flexing the torso during low bed ingress. Torque data from the egress motion were similar, however 50% of participants were unable to rise from the low bed without assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers should be aware that low bed heights pose safety risks to the population for which they were designed--elderly persons at high risk for falling.

Tools for Fall risk factors and the nature of falls in inpatient oncology and palliative care settings.

Fall risk factors and the nature of falls in inpatient oncology and palliative care settings.
By:O'Connell B;Wellman D;Cockayne M;+1 moreIn:Contemporary Nurse: A Journal for the Australian Nursing Profession, Apr-Jun2005, volume 18, issue 3, pages 247-257 (11p)CINAHL
Using a prospective design, this study examined falls risk factors and the nature of patient falls in oncology and palliative care settings. Two hundred and twenty seven patients admitted to the oncology and palliative care units at a private hospital participated in this study. Of these, 34 patients had a fall and 193 patients did not have a fall. Twenty-four nurses who attended to patients who fell were interviewed. Findings revealed that, when compared to patients who did not fall, fallers had a significantly higher mean age; were assessed as more physically dependent using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale; were less alert and more confused; were more likely to have responded incorrectly to orientation to person, time and place; were weaker pre-fall in arm muscle strength; and were more fatigued. These factors are worthy of further exploration to determine whether they are more sensitive than the currently used falls risk factors used in oncology and palliative care settings.

Missed nursing care, staffing, and patient falls.
By:Kalisch BJ;Tschannen D;Lee KHIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, 2012 Jan-Mar, volume 27, issue 1, pages 6-12 (7p)CINAHL
Patient falls in hospitals continue to be a major and costly problem. This study tested the mediating effect of missed nursing care on the relationship of staffing levels (hours per patient day [HPPD]) and patient falls. The sample was 124 patient units in 11 hospitals. The HPPD was negatively associated with patient falls (r = -0.36, P < .01), and missed nursing care was found to mediate the relationship between HPPD and patient falls.

Tools for The relationship between patient blood pathology values and patient falls in an acute-care setting: a retrospective analysis.

The relationship between patient blood pathology values and patient falls in an acute-care setting: a retrospective analysis.
By:O'Hagan C;O'Connell BIn:International Journal of Nursing Practice (Wiley-Blackwell), Aug2005, volume 11, issue 4, pages 161-168 (8p)CINAHL
Few studies have investigated the relationship between patient falls and patient blood pathology values, which can reveal objective information about the health and nutritional status of a patient. It could be that some abnormal values are associated with patients that fall. The objectives of the current study were to determine whether blood pathology values were different in patients who fell compared to patients who did not fall, and whether there was a difference in the type and number of currently documented risk factors for falls found for patients who fell compared to patients who did not fall. A retrospective audit of patient incident reports and medical records was conducted in an acute-care hospital for 220 patients who fell and who did not fall. Faller and non-faller patients were matched by casemix type and length of stay. Findings revealed a significant relationship between patients who fell and the variables of age, confusion status and alkaline phosphatase blood values.

Tools for Fall prevention conceptual framework.

Fall prevention conceptual framework.
By:Abraham, SamIn:Health Care Manager, 2011 Apr-Jun, volume 30, issue 2, pages 179-184 (6p)CINAHL
Falls can have lasting psychological and physical consequences, particularly fractures and slow-healing processes, and patients may also lose confidence in walking. Injuries from falls lead to functional decline, institutionalization, higher health care costs, and decreased quality of life. The process related to the problem of patient falls in the hospital, using the nursing model developed by the theorist, Ida Jean Orlando, is explained in this article. The useful tool that provides guidance to marketers in this endeavor is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. During acute illness, individuals are greatly in need of satisfying their physiological needs. If these needs are not met, patients leave the hospital lacking a positive experience. Initial fall risk assessment is critical to plan intervention and individualize care plan. Interventions depend on the severity of fall risk factors.

Objective: From a public health perspective, the effectiveness of any prevention program depends on integrated medical and managerial strategies. In this way, quality management methods drawn from organization and business management can help design prevention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the potential value of these methods in the specific context of preventing falls in hospital.Setting: Medical and Rehabilitation Care Unit of Saint-Maurice National Hospital (France).Design: In phase 1, two surveys assessed the context in which falls occurred. The first survey (1995) quantified adverse events during a 1-year period (n = 564) and the second (1996-1997) documented the reasons for falls (n = 53). In phase 2, a set of recommendations to prevent falls was elaborated and implemented throughout the hospital.Results: The fall frequency in this unit was 18.3% in 1995. Analysis showed organizational causes in 35 (66%) of the 53 documented falls; 24 of them were associated with individual factors. Even though the two categories of causes are interdependent, their distinction enables specific recommendations. The proposed organizational management changes recommended do not aim to achieve an illusory objective of 'zero falls', but are designed to reduce the number of avoidable falls and to limit the negative consequences of unavoidable falls.Conclusion: Quality improvement methods shed new light on how to prevent falls. An unexploited potential for prevention lies in organization and management of care for hospitalized patients.

Tools for Development of a Pediatric Fall Risk And Injury Reduction Program.

Development of a Pediatric Fall Risk And Injury Reduction Program.
By:Kramlich, Debra L.;Dende, DeniseIn:Pediatric Nursing, Mar/Apr2016, volume 42, issue 2, pages 77-82 (6p)CINAHL
Fall prevention programs that include reliable, valid, and clinically tested screening tools have demonstrated more positive effects for adult and geriatric populations than those not including such assessment. In contrast, because falling is a natural part of growth and development for pediatric patients, progression toward effective prevention programs for this population has proven to be a challenge; a significant impediment is the lack of definition regarding what constitutes a reportable fall. This project explored pediatric health care providers' perceptions of patient falls in order to define a reportable pediatric fall and inform development of a prevention program. A concept analysis of defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences of pediatric falls from literature formed the basis for a set of questions; a convenience sample of 28 pediatric health care providers in an acute care hospital in New England participated in six moderated focus groups. Constant comparison method was used to code the qualitative data and develop themes. Participants unanimously agreed on several points; as expected, their years of experience in pediatric practice provided valuable insight. Three major themes emerged: patient characteristics, caregiver characteristics, and environmental characteristics. Based on factors identified by staff, a screening tool was adopted and integrated into the electronic medical record. Staff were actively engaged in developing definitions, selecting tools, and identifying next steps toward a comprehensive fall reduction program for their patients. As a result, they have embraced changes and advocated successfully for endorsement by the organization.

Frequency and circumstances of falls in acute care hospitals: a pilot study.
By:Schwendimann RIn:Pflege, 1998 Dec, volume 11, issue 6, pages 335-341 (7p)CINAHL
Falls among (elderly) patients are common in institutional settings. Falls may lead to fright, pain, slight or severe injuries, they may increase the duration of the hospital stay, patient discomfort and affect the quality of life. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the incidence of patient falls in a public hospital (300 beds) in the city of Zurich and to test a fall report form to assess patients after the event. 372 falls were reported during the 12 month evaluation period from 1996 to 1997 (6.7 falls per 1000 patiendays) in 9 wards with 184 beds for patients requiring both acute care and/or longer term geriatric rehabilitation, 207 (56%) of the falls remained without detectable consequences, 6 (1.6%) of the patients suffered from serious (fracture), and 89 (24%) from slight injuries (contusions, abrasions, lacerations). Most of the falls (286) happened unattended in the patient rooms, 162 (44%) of the patients have been found disoriented, and only 60 (16%) were able to ambulate independently (without using a device or personal assistance). Almost 50% (182) of the falls occurred within ten days after admission. No peaks during the day in the time of falling were seen. The hospital management recommended the use of an official incident reporting form (fall-protocol) for all units since January 1998. The development of a hospital-wide fall prevention program is being prepared.

Tools for The relationship between different missed care activities and patient outcomes: A systematic review.

The relationship between different missed care activities and patient outcomes: A systematic review.
By:He, Wenqi;Yuan, Hua;Luo, Wei;+4 moreIn:International Journal of Nursing Studies, Nov2025, volume 171, page N.PAGCINAHL
Missed care is a key indicator of nursing quality and has been linked to negative patient outcomes. However, the rates of missed care vary across different nursing activities. Treating missed care as a composite indicator may lack specificity in relation to patient outcomes. This review aims to explore the relationship between different missed care activities and patient outcomes. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for relevant studies published up to November 2024. Studies examining the relationship between missed care activities and patient outcomes were included. The risk of bias was evaluated using the NICE public health review guidelines, and the PRISMA guidelines were followed in reporting this review. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024618442). After screening, 17 articles were included. Most studies were cross-sectional, relying on nurse or patient self-reporting to assess missed care. This review found that different types of missed care activities were related to various patient outcomes. The main findings were as follows: 1) missed clinical care activities were closely linked to patient safety outcomes. Specifically, omissions in patient monitoring, basic care, treatment and symptom management were significantly associated with adverse events such as falls, readmissions, mortality, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections; 2) missed communication and basic care were strongly associated with reduced patient satisfaction; 3) additionally, specific patient outcomes, such as time to achieve full oral feeding and length of hospital stay, were also associated with missed clinical care activities. Although high-quality evidence remains limited, it is clear that different missed care activities are linked to varying patient outcomes, suggesting that their effects on the patient outcomes differ across activities. Future research should focus on developing targeted intervention strategies to reduce missed care activities that are closely linked to patient outcomes.

Tools for Prediction or Prevention? Nurse Interactions with an Electronic Early Warning System for Fall Risk.

Prediction or Prevention? Nurse Interactions with an Electronic Early Warning System for Fall Risk.
By:McCollum, Meriel;Wu, Yimei;Spiva, LeeAnnaIn:Joint Commission Journal on Quality & Patient Safety, Nov2025, volume 51, issue 11, pages 690-694 (5p)CINAHL
Predictive models using machine learning technology are increasingly being incorporated into electronic health records to support staff in risk assessment and prediction of adverse outcomes. There is little research available related to how this technology fits into the nursing workflow or its effects on nurse behaviors or actual patient outcomes. Retrospective data from four medical/surgical units were examined to explore nurse interactions with the interruptive alerts produced by the model and their chronological relation to actual falls. During the study period, 1.5% of all admissions resulted in at least one fall, and 87.0% of admissions resulted in at least one fall alert being produced by the system. Most alerts (57.3%) were dismissed by the receiver using the Snooze to Review option, and 22.0% of alerts were shown to staff members other than the primary nurse caring for the patient. Most falls (89.3%) were preceded by an alert being shown to any staff member, but a smaller number of falls (38.7%) were preceded by an alert being shown to the primary nurse. In most fall cases in this sample, the primary nurse caring for the patient had never been exposed to an alert. However, most alerts were dismissed by nurses using the Snooze to Review option. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between nurse exposure to interruptive alerts and associated actions taken by nursing staff to prevent falls. Machine learning technology should be carefully studied and optimized to suit the needs and workflow of the staff and patients it is intended to serve.

Tools for A Multihospital Analysis of Clinician-Reported Safety Events in People Living with Dementia: Contributing Factors and System Recommendations.

A Multihospital Analysis of Clinician-Reported Safety Events in People Living with Dementia: Contributing Factors and System Recommendations.

People living with dementia (PLWD) are hospitalized at higher rates than those without dementia and are particularly vulnerable to safety events in the hospital. This study aimed to characterize the scope of clinician-reported safety events in PLWD, identify contributing factors from the perspective of reporting clinicians, and categorize clinician recommendations for system improvement. The authors analyzed safety events reported by clinicians between January 2018 and July 2023 through a voluntary reporting system at a 10-hospital health system in the mid-Atlantic region, representing a broad spectrum of hospitals and patient populations. A total of 1,287 clinician-reported safety events in PLWD were identified using a keyword search. Two researchers coded the event reports using validated taxonomies to classify contributing factors and clinician recommendations for improvement. The most common clinician-reported safety events among PLWD were skin/tissue injuries (59.4%), falls (17.2%), and safety/security issues (6.9%). The most frequently cited contributing factors were situational factors (70.0%) and active failures (11.2%). Most clinician reports (65.6%) did not include any recommendation for improvement; 30.0% included person-based recommendations, and only 4.4% included system-based recommendations. Health systems should prioritize the prevention of pressure injuries and falls—two of the most common and preventable safety events. Effective interventions should integrate both person-based (for example, staff training, patient/family education) and system-based (for example, policies, protocols) strategies to improve safety for PLWD in the hospital.

Aims: To develop a method for computationally detecting fall events using clinical language models to complement existing self‐reporting mechanisms. Design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Text data were collected from the unstructured nursing notes of three hospitals' electronic health records and the Korean national patient safety reports, totalling 34,480 records covering the period from January 2015 to December 2019. Note‐level labelling was conducted by two researchers with 95% agreement. Preprocessing data anonymisation and English translation were followed by semantic validation. Five language models based on pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)‐4 with prompt programming were explored. Model performance was assessed using F measurements. Error analysis was conducted for the GPT‐4 results. Results: Fine‐tuned BERT models with the English data set outperformed GPT‐4, with Bio+Clinical BERT achieving the highest F1 score of 0.98. Fine‐tuned Korean BERT with the Korean data set also reached an F1 score of 0.98, while GPT‐4 achieved a competitive F1 score of 0.94. GPT‐4 with prompt programming showed much higher F1 scores than GPT‐4 with a standardised prompt for the English data set (0.85 vs. 0.39) and the Korean data set (0.94 vs. 0.03). The error analysis identified that the common misclassification patterns included fall history and homonyms, causing false positives and implicit expressions and missing contextual information, causing false negatives. Conclusion: The clinical language model approach, if used alongside the existing self‐reporting, promises to increase the chance of identifying the majority of factual falls without the need for additional chart reviews. Impact: Inpatient falls are often underreported, with up to 91% of incidents missed in self‐reports. Using language models, we identified a significant portion of these unreported falls, improving the accuracy of adverse event tracking while reducing the self‐reporting burden on nurses. Patient or Public Contribution: Not applicable.

Background: Frailty and Parkinson's disease share overlapping clinical features, making it challenging to distinguish between the two. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of frailty in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) to prevent the progression of frailty. Aims: We sought to understand existing evidence on frailty in PwP. Design: This study was a scoping review. A literature search was conducted using 7 databases and hand-searching in September 2023. Results: A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. In both clinical and community settings, the frailty phenotype was most commonly used to assess frailty. The prevalence of frailty was inconsistent according to the measures used, and frailty measures assessing cumulative deficits tended to result in higher frailty rates. Compared with PwP who exhibited robustness, PwP with frailty were older, had more severe Parkinson symptoms, and took higher doses of levodopa. Frailty worsened as Parkinson symptoms became more severe, and doses of levodopa increased. Conclusion: Recognizing the specific characteristics of PwP with frailty is important to identify at-risk individuals and initiate timely interventions. Considering that PwP requires regular monitoring, it is recommended to use frailty measures that can capture multidimensional and cumulative aspects of frailty.

The impact of using "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode on the performance and satisfaction of internship nursing students in the training of fall prevention education ability: a randomized controlled trial.
By:Yang, Jie;Mao, Tianyang;Zhou, Li;+8 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 10/22/2025, volume 24, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Clinical internships are a crucial component of nursing education, offering students the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a clinical setting. Patient falls represent a common issue in hospitals and are a central focus of patient safety management. Enhancing nursing students' proficiency in fall prevention education during their internships is essential for advancing patient safety and improving future care quality. Methods: This study involved 159 nursing students who were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group, consisting of 80 students, participated in a three-step training mode labeled 'teach, exercise, and practice' Meanwhile, the remaining 79 students in the control group received training through traditional teaching methods. Both groups underwent training to enhance their skills in fall prevention education. Following the training, assessments included a theoretical examination, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), and a teaching satisfaction survey. Data collected were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and χ² test. Results: In the theoretical examination, both the experimental group and the control group demonstrated equivalent effectiveness, with significant improvements post-intervention; however, no significant differences were observed between the two groups (P = 0.884). In the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), the experimental group performed notably better in several areas: evaluation of patients and their families (P = 0.044), environmental assessment and education (P = 0.003), education on patient mobility out of bed (P < 0.001), and communication skills (P < 0.001). Regarding satisfaction, the experimental group, which followed the "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode, reported higher levels of satisfaction (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Compared to traditional teaching methods, the "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode reinforces the knowledge among internship nursing students regarding risk assessment for falls and strengthens their ability to provide health education on fall prevention. It enhances the satisfaction of nursing students with their training. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of fall prevention theory with clinical practice for internship nursing students, thereby improving their proficiency in delivering fall prevention education. Clinical trail number: Not applicable.

Tools for Molecular Testing and Surgical Outcomes in Bethesda III and IV Thyroid Nodules: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Molecular Testing and Surgical Outcomes in Bethesda III and IV Thyroid Nodules: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
By:Payne, Alexandra E.;Gobeil, Layla;Pusztaszeri, Marc P.;+4 moreIn:Cancers, Oct2025, volume 17, issue 20, page 3376CINAHL
Simple Summary: Thyroid nodules are frequently encountered in clinical practice, particularly among women. Although the majority are benign, indeterminate cytology remains a diagnostic challenge. Bethesda III and IV nodules represent categories with an uncertain risk of malignancy, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or suboptimal interventions. Molecular testing has emerged as a promising adjunct to refine risk stratification and tailor surgical management. This study investigated the role of molecular testing in guiding optimal treatment for Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules, demonstrating its potential to reduce overtreatment and undertreatment and improve clinical outcomes. Background: Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules, which fall under the category of indeterminate cytology, pose challenges in clinical decision-making due to their ambiguous risk of malignancy. Molecular testing has been increasingly employed to aid risk stratification and optimize the extent of surgical intervention. Methods: A retrospective review of 410 patients with Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules who underwent thyroid surgery at McGill University teaching hospitals between January 2016 and April 2022. Patients were grouped based on whether or not they underwent preoperative molecular testing. Data were collected on demographic variables, histopathologic diagnosis, mutation profiles, and surgical outcomes. The primary outcome was to assess for concordance between surgical intervention and final pathology in both groups, with a focus on identifying optimal versus suboptimal management. Optimal management is defined as surgery appropriate to the aggressiveness of disease, meaning a hemi-thyroidectomy for a non-aggressive malignancy, total thyroidectomy for an aggressive malignancy, and no surgery for a benign nodule. Furthermore, suboptimal management includes unnecessary surgery or incorrect surgery for the level of aggressivity of the nodule. Results: Among the 410 patients, 203 underwent molecular testing, while 207 did not. Of those who underwent molecular testing, 117 had Bethesda III nodules and 86 had Bethesda IV nodules. In the non-tested group, 129 and 78 patients had Bethesda III and IV nodules, respectively. Optimal surgical intervention was achieved in 67.5% of patients who underwent molecular testing, compared with 25.1% in those who did not (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that 61.5% of Bethesda III nodules with molecular testing received optimal care versus 21.0% of those without testing. In the Bethesda IV cohort, optimal surgery was achieved in 75.6% with testing versus 32.1% without. Among the suboptimally managed patients, 70.1% (155/221) were from the group that did not undergo molecular testing. In addition, molecular testing identified aggressive mutations such as BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations more frequently in Bethesda III nodules, while RAS-like mutations, associated with indolent behavior, predominated in Bethesda IV nodules. Conclusions: In this study, molecular testing significantly improved risk stratification and the likelihood of optimal surgical management in patients with Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules. Incorporating molecular diagnostics into the standard preoperative workflow may enhance patient care, reduce unnecessary surgeries, and optimize the extent of surgery. Future studies should evaluate the cost-effectiveness and broader implementation of molecular testing in diverse healthcare settings.

Tools for Cost-utility analysis of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in second-line and third-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in Germany.

Cost-utility analysis of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in second-line and third-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in Germany.
By:Brinkmann, Carolin;Baum, Richard P.;Stargardt, TomIn:European Journal of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging, Oct2025, volume 52, issue 12, pages 4377-4389 (13p)CINAHL
Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (PRLT) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in Germany by comparing (I) PRLT plus standard-of-care (SoC) versus SoC alone as third-line treatment and (II) PRLT versus second-line cabazitaxel chemotherapy. Methods: Cohort state-transition models were developed with (I) four health states (treatment, stable after treatment, progression, death) and (II) six health states (treatment, stable after treatment, third-line treatment after progression, stable after third-line treatment, next progression, death). Transition probabilities were derived from the VISION and TheraP trials, and quality-of-life data from the VISION and CARD trials. Costs were derived from statutory health insurance claims data (2019–2022). Models simulated a five-year horizon with one-month cycles, applying within-cycle correction and a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty. Results: For Model I, PRLT plus SoC compared to SoC incurred incremental costs of €27,200 per patient, with a gain of 0.39 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €69,418 per QALY gained. In Model II, PRLT plus SoC compared to cabazitaxel achieved incremental savings of €1,460 per patient and a QALY gain of 0.11, making it the dominant option. Conclusion: Although Germany lacks an explicit willingness-to-pay threshold for interpreting the ICER of Model I, it falls within the range of other reimbursed cancer therapies. This suggests PRLT is cost-effective as second- or third-line treatment for mCRPC. Between 2019 and 2022, hospitals mainly used self-produced 177Lu-PSMA-617, which was less costly than the product now commercially available, limiting the generalizability of our findings.

Tools for Contributing factors to missed nursing care: A systematic review with clinical implications for practice and patient safety.

Contributing factors to missed nursing care: A systematic review with clinical implications for practice and patient safety.
By:Breno, Federica;Marchetti, Daniele;Cattani, Daniela;+4 moreIn:Applied Nursing Research, Oct2025, volume 85, page N.PAGCINAHL
Missed Nursing Care (MNC) is increasingly recognized as an indicator of care quality and a potential contributor to adverse events. This systematic review aimed to explore the correlation between MNC and adverse events in hospitalized patients across public and private settings. A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and TripDatabase between January and February 2025. Included studies were quantitative, published in English or Italian, and focused on acute hospital settings. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist; risk of bias was evaluated with ROBINS-I. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 13,619 nurses and 902 patients. Study designs included four cross-sectional, two observational (one correlational), and one secondary data analysis. Five studies reported a positive association between MNC and adverse events, while two found inverse or non-significant relationships. Common adverse outcomes included falls, infections, pressure ulcers, and medication errors. Despite methodological heterogeneity and limitations—such as the use of non-validated tools or contextual differences—the evidence suggests a consistent association between MNC and adverse events. These findings underscore the importance of addressing missed care as a patient safety concern. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm causality and inform predictive models. Recognition of the link between MNC and adverse events should prompt healthcare organizations to address care omissions through staffing optimization, safety culture, and clinical governance. Targeted interventions may reduce preventable harm and improve care quality. • Missed Nursing Care (MNC) is significantly associated with preventable adverse events in hospitals. • Most frequently omitted interventions involve emotional support, patient education, hygiene, and discharge planning. • High workloads, inadequate staffing, and limited resources are key organizational factors contributing to MNC. • MNC should be considered both a quality-of-care indicator and a modifiable risk factor for patient safety. • Targeted strategies focusing on adequate staffing, workload distribution, and positive safety culture can reduce care omissions.

Tools for Reducing Effects of HospitalAssociated Deconditioning in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

Reducing Effects of HospitalAssociated Deconditioning in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
By:Schmitz, Jena;Weigl, Brittany;Patterson, Amy;+3 moreIn:Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing, Oct2025, volume 29, issue 5, pages 416-422 (7p)CINAHL
Prolonged hospitalization and treatment-related toxicities increase the risks of immobility and decreased functional status in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). This quality improvement project evaluated whether targeted education and access to a stationary elliptical bike (SEB) could reduce hospital-associated deconditioning in 106 adult patients undergoing allo HSCT. Using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, findings suggest that SEBs are a safe and feasible approach for preserving functional status during prolonged hospitalization in patients undergoing allo HSCT.

Tools for Effectiveness of interventions in increasing physical activity of inpatients after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Effectiveness of interventions in increasing physical activity of inpatients after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
By:Hartley, Peter;Bond, Katie;Dance, Rachel;+3 moreIn:Clinical Rehabilitation, Oct2025, volume 39, issue 10, pages 1277-1295 (19p)CINAHL
Objective: To synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to increase levels of physical activity or reduce levels of sedentary activity of inpatients after a new stroke. Data sources: Medline, PsychINFO, AMED and CINAHL were search between inception and June 2025 for randomised controlled studies of in-hospital interventions for adults after stroke which measured physical activity. Review methods: Interventions were grouped by common components. For each intervention group, the outcomes of physical activity (primary outcome), physical functional ability, and quality of life were analysed with meta-analysis. Adverse events were synthesised narratively. Results: Ten studies (696 participants) were included in the review. General activity feedback (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI: −0.07 to 1.10; I 2 = 76.7%, 4 trials, n = 272) and additional physiotherapy (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.99; I 2 = 94.2%, 4 trials, n = 246) may result in moderate to large increases of in-hospital physical activity (very low certainty). Patient-directed activity programmes (one study) may have no effect on physical activity (low certainty). Upper-limb activity feedback (one study) may increase upper-limb activity (very low certainty). The evidence regarding the secondary outcomes demonstrated no effect (very low to moderate certainty), with the exception that additional physiotherapy may increase the risk of falls (low certainty). Conclusions: Interventions incorporating activity feedback or additional physiotherapy are promising, but further evidence is required for all interventions to increase the certainty in their estimates of effect.

Objectives. To estimate the probability of adverse events based on the length of emergency department (ED) stay prior to hospitalization in patients aged > 65 treated in Spanish EDs. Method. All patients aged $ 65 years treated in 52 Spanish EDs during a 1-week period and included in the EDEN (Emergency Department and Elder Needs) Registry who were hospitalized and had available data on the length of ED stay were included in the study. Adverse events considered were in-hospital mortality and prolonged hospitalization (> 7 days) in patients discharged alive. Non-linear models using restricted cubic splines were applied to estimate the probability of adverse events as a function of the length of ED stay, and crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, adjusting for 13 demographic, baseline health, and vital sign variables. First-order interactions with covariates were also examined. Results. A total of 6,333 patients were included. The length of ED stay ranged from 0 to 240 hours prior to hospital admission (median, 6 hours; and 12.6%, 3.5%, 1.5%, and 0.2% of patients remained in the ED for more than 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, respectively). A total of 683 patients (10.8%) died during hospitalization, and among survivors, 2,734 (46.9%) experienced prolonged hospitalization. Compared with patients with a 12-hour ED stay (reference), those with stays of 6 and 3 hours had adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality of 1.11 (1.01-1.22) and 1.22 (1.03-1.44), and defor prolonged hospitalization of 0.89 (0.84-0.95) and 0.83 (0.75-0.93), respectively. For ED stays of 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, the adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality were 1.00 (0.94-1.06), 1.18 (0.97-1.43), 1.39 (0.98-1.97), and 2.70 (1.02-7.13), and for prolonged hospitalization, 1.14 (1.09-1.19), 1.39 (1.17-1.62), 1.66 (1.25-2.21), and 3.53 (1.60-7.76), respectively. Patients with functional limitation and hypotension showed a stronger association between the length of ED stay and in-hospital mortality, while those aged < 80 years and without prior falls showed a stronger association between the length of ED stay and prolonged hospitalization. Conclusions. Both short and long ED stays in patients who are subsequently hospitalized were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, shorter stays were associated with a lower likelihood of prolonged hospitalization, whereas longer stays were associated with a higher likelihood of prolonged hospitalization. These associations may be significantly stronger in certain patient subgroups.

Tools for Computed Tomography Head Ordering Practices in Residential Aged Care Facility Residents Presenting to Emergency Department After an Unwitnessed Fall.

Computed Tomography Head Ordering Practices in Residential Aged Care Facility Residents Presenting to Emergency Department After an Unwitnessed Fall.
By:Chen, Elizabeth;Donohue, Clover;Sweeny, Amy;+3 moreIn:Emergency Medicine Australasia, Oct2025, volume 37, issue 5, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Objective: To determine CT head imaging rates, yield and emergent intervention rate (neurosurgery, cessation or reversal of anticoagulants) in residential aged care facility (RACF) residents presenting to ED with an unwitnessed fall. Secondary objectives included a description of shared decision‐making discussions with patients or substitute decision makers regarding ED transfer and CT head imaging. Methods: Retrospective cross‐sectional study of residential aged care residents aged over 65 years presenting with unwitnessed falls at two university‐affiliated tertiary EDs between 1 January and 30 June 2024. Dual independent data extraction of medical records assessed CT imaging use and yield, which was defined as new intracranial haemorrhage on the radiology report. Change of management and shared decision‐making were defined by documentation in the medical record. Data analyses were descriptive, and associations were reported using the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of 398 patients, 235 (59%) underwent CTH imaging and intracranial haemorrhage was identified in 10 patients (4.3%). No patients underwent neurosurgery. Anticoagulation was ceased in four patients. Shared decision‐making was documented for hospital transfer in 14.1% of patients, 13.8% of patients receiving CTH and 25.1% among patients who did not undergo imaging. Patients with signs of head injury, on anticoagulation or evidence of polytrauma were more likely to receive a CTH. Conclusions: CT head imaging was common among RACF residents with unwitnessed falls despite low diagnostic yield and infrequent changes in management, with no neurosurgical intervention in our cohort. Limited documentation of SDM calls for stronger integration of meaningful patient‐centred discussions to reduce avoidable transfers and imaging.

Fall prevention among adult surgical patients in Tabriz, Iran: a best practice implementation project.
By:Nouri, Mehdi;Talebpour, Amin;Hajebrahimi, Sakineh;+3 moreIn:JBI Evidence Implementation, Oct2025, volume 23, issue 4, pages 444-452 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: Falling out of bed is the most common unintentional cause of injury among patients and is a major safety problem in health care facilities. Current practices for fall prevention may not always be aligned with established best practices, leading to variability in patient outcomes. This uncertainty underscores the need to assess and improve compliance with best practice guidelines for fall prevention. Objectives: This project aimed to improve fall prevention in the surgical ward of a general hospital in Tabriz, Iran. Methods: This study was guided by the JBI Evidence Implementation Framework. A baseline audit was conducted using 11 audit criteria representing best practices for fall prevention. After the implementation of improvement strategies, a follow-up audit was conducted to evaluate changes in practice. Results: The results revealed significant improvements, notably, fall risk assessment upon admission (87% to 92%), fall risk assessment upon ward transfer (39% to 79%), patient participation in fall risk assessment (26% to 68%), reassessment upon change in condition (53% to 74%), communicating fall prevention information to at-risk patients and their families/caregivers (42% to 63%), engagement of patients (100% to 100%), implementation of targeted strategies (89% to 92%), post-fall assessment and interventions (82% to 87%), revising patient fall risk status and reviewing care management plan (41% to 74%), fall prevention information to patients and their families/caregivers upon discharge (44% to 66%), and person-centered education of health care professionals (77% to 81%). Conclusion: The use of standard clinical audit tools in hospitals can improve the quality of patient care and increase the effectiveness of interventions by identifying weaknesses in the patient care process. http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/IJEBH/A283

Person-centered falls prevention and management in neurological post-operative patients: a best practice implementation project.
By:Wang, Cha-Chi;Liang, Ching-Chang;Teng, Ming-Yuan;+6 moreIn:JBI Evidence Implementation, Oct2025, volume 23, issue 4, pages 462-473 (12p)CINAHL
Background: Accidental falls among inpatients are a significant cause of hospital-acquired injury. Appropriate evidence-based strategies to prevent falls and standard operating procedures for fall prevention and management are vital to mitigate the risk of falls in hospitals. Objective: The objective of this study was to improve fall prevention practices among health care practitioners and post-operative patients in a neurology ward through the implementation of evidence-based practices. Methods: This project followed the seven-phase JBI Evidence Implementation Framework, which uses a pre- and post-test audit methodology. A baseline audit was conducted of fall management practices among 60 health care staff and 40 patients in a hospital in Taiwan. Using the baseline audit results, barriers to best practices were identified and improvement strategies were developed to address the barriers. A follow-up audit was conducted to measure improvements. Results: Post-implementation audit compliance rates improved from baseline. Specifically, the compliance rate for Criteria 1, 3, 5, and 10 increased to 100%. Compliance also increased for Criteria 2 (90%), 4 (93%), 6 (95%), 7 (95%), 8 (88%), 9 (88%), and 11 (97%). Conclusion: This study used best practices to reduce the incidence of falls, which did not exceed 0.08%. Key factors contributing to the success of the project included a democratic approach to leadership, multidisciplinary interventions, the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle, and on-the-job training for nurses. http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/IJEBH/A409

Tools for Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.

Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.
By:Gaguski, Michele E.In:Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing, Oct2025, volume 27, issue 5, pages E241-E247CINAHL
Although patient falls in the acute care setting have been thoroughly studied, published studies exploring falls for patients receiving hospice care remain limited. Patients receiving hospice care present with considerable risk factors for falls, including physical and cognitive changes associated with a terminal diagnosis. An increasing pattern of patient fall rates was identified at the organization and a quality initiative was developed to address this aspect of patient care. The SMART aim of this project was to establish a sustainable process to decrease the percentage of patient falls from 5% to 3% in an organization's hospice regional branch within a 3-month period. This project adopted the Plan-Do-Study-Act process as its change model. A bundled intervention was introduced including early referrals to the therapy team for newly admitted patients, staff education, and providing supplemental patient education. The measurable outcome was to achieve a decrease in fall rates. Although the goal was not achieved within the 3-month timeframe, data did indicate a positive trend toward the intended goal. Results indicated ongoing opportunities for nurses to enhance reliability in making therapy referrals. However, nurses demonstrated consistency in providing supplemental education.

Ubiquitous and enduring, nursing values transcend settings, systems, and time. In this article, the key challenges facing Taiwan's nursing workforce are analyzed through the lenses of workforce data, stakeholder dialogues, and policy. The four major policy directions outlined include: the implementation of a three-shift nurse-patient ratio system, promotion of flexible and autonomous nursing practice, development of nurse-friendly model hospitals, and expansion of advanced nursing roles. The goal of these include: revisiting workforce challenges through evidence, establishing a sustained policy dialogue platform, and achieving more-effective strategic action. With robust and thoughtful policy support, nurses may not only fall in love with their profession and choose to remain but also find fulfillment, as encapsulated in the phrase "Proud to be a Nurse."

Tools for Association Between Nurse Turnover and Nurses' Perception of Patient Outcomes in Acute Care Hospitals in South Korea.

Association Between Nurse Turnover and Nurses' Perception of Patient Outcomes in Acute Care Hospitals in South Korea.
By:Bae, Sung-HeuiIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, Oct-Dec2025, volume 40, issue 4, pages E57-E63CINAHL
Background: High turnover rates among nurses are a global concern. Previous studies show the negative impact on quality of care. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between nurse turnover and nurse's perceptions of patient outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Nurses working in 35 general hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate in a survey assessing their perceptions of patient outcomes, including quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events. Nurse turnover was measured for the prior 6 months. Results: Data from 159 nurses were analyzed. There was a significant positive relationship between turnover rates and perceptions of poor quality of care, after controlling for demographic and work-related characteristics. Nurse turnover was not significantly associated with perceptions of patient safety or adverse events. Conclusions: The negative consequence of nurse turnover on patient outcomes is partially supported in this study.

Determinants of Harm in Fall Incidents in Hospital Settings With 200 or More Beds in Korea.
By:Kang, Youngmi;Hong, EunyoungIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Oct2025, volume 21, issue 7, pages 480-487 (8p)CINAHL
Objective: Falls are a significant patient safety concern in hospital settings, often resulting in unintended harm. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for falls in Korean hospitals with 200 or more beds, analyzing 13,034 incidents reported to the Korean Patient Safety Reporting and Learning System from 2017 to 2021. Methods: The level of harm was classified into 3 categories: near-miss, adverse, and sentinel events. Hospital-related factors (hospital type, bed capacity, and location and time of fall incident) and patient-related factors (sex, age group, and admitting medical department) were included in the analysis. χ2 tests were used to evaluate differences in fall severity, and binary logistic regression identified factors associated with harmful incidents. Results: The study found that harmful falls were more likely to occur in nontertiary hospitals, particularly those with >500 beds, as well as in emergency departments. Furthermore, older female patients and those admitted to the internal medicine department are especially at risk. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, especially in nontertiary hospitals with >500 beds, comprehensive strategies for preventing falls, including the promotion of patient safety culture, are needed to reduce fall occurrence and its associated disabilities.

Tools for Development of an Evidence-Based Instrument to Justify the Use of Physical Restraint in General Adult Ward Settings: A Systematic Review.

Development of an Evidence-Based Instrument to Justify the Use of Physical Restraint in General Adult Ward Settings: A Systematic Review.
By:Tsang, Lap Fung;So, Kin Fung;Ng, Cheuk Fung;+4 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Oct2025, volume 21, issue 7, pages e126-e144CINAHL
Background: Physical restraint is commonly applied in the clinical settings despite numerous studies presenting its paucity of efficacy and safety. Despite the various tangible and intangible factors associated with moral and safety issues, nurses must make decisions on restraint use in ethical dilemmas. Health care providers often find it challenging to make appropriate decisions regarding the use of physical restraint in demanding clinical environments without a standard and objective assessment tool. Objectives: The objectives aimed to identify effective instrument to justify the decision-making regarding the use of physical restraint in general adult ward settings. Methods: A literature search was conducted on several electronic databases, including Medline, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Embase, and Cochrane Library, using subject MeSH headings and relevant keywords to identify any relevant studies pertaining to the research question. Only articles written in English from January 2014 to March 2024 were considered. The search was filtered by screening for articles with the full-text availability, cohort studies that are not considered an experimental studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analysis. The reference lists of literatures were also searched to identify any further relevant studies. Results: Eight studies were included in this review, consisting of 6 cohort studies, 1 stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial, and 1 systematic review. The quality of the studies ranged from low to moderate, with the risk of bias being moderate to high. The interventions retrieved from the included studies can be categorized as restraint decision instruments, restraint preventive interventions and restraint preventive strategies. All included studies reported a significantly improved rate of restrained patients in the intervention group comparing to the control group. The rate of restrained patient days decreased significantly in the intervention group. There was no significant difference in the rate and number of accidental catheter removal, fall incident, and length of stay. Conclusions: Implementing the evidence-based instrument can help improve patient outcomes, reduce inappropriate use of physical restraint, and provide a structured decision-making process for health care staff. An evidence-based assessment instrument is developed to assess patients who are necessary to be given physical restraint, and further stringent research is necessary to evaluate the effect of such instrument. Training on least restrictive techniques and effective strategies is crucial for nurses to ensure adherence of nurses and appropriate care for patients.

Tools for Patterns of Benzodiazepines and Hypnotic Drugs Dispensing After Hip Fracture Among Older US Adults Previously on the Drugs.

Patterns of Benzodiazepines and Hypnotic Drugs Dispensing After Hip Fracture Among Older US Adults Previously on the Drugs.
By:Pan, Meng;Duchesneau, Emilie D.;Miller, Elyse M.;+5 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Oct2025, volume 73, issue 10, pages 3095-3104 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Benzodiazepines (BZD) and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (Z‐drugs) strongly increase the risk for hip fractures and should be avoided among older adults with a fall or fracture history. We assessed BZD and Z‐drugs refill patterns after discharge for hip fracture among older US adults and explored factors associated with refilling. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries (20% random sample) aged ≥ 66 years, hospitalized for hip fracture, and discharged home or to a skilled nursing facility. Eligible patients had ≥ 365 days of Medicare Parts A, B, and D coverage and filled a BZD (2013–2019) or Z‐drug (2008–2019) ≤ 90 days before hospitalization. We estimated cumulative incidences of refilling the same/increased dose (continuation) and reduced dose (reduction) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) within 180 days after discharge, stratified by drug class. We examined demographic factors, comorbidities, and geriatric conditions associated with continuation versus deprescribing (reduction or no refill). Results: We included 21,123 eligible patients [11,465 (54%) on short/intermediate‐acting BZD, 3473 (16%) on long‐acting BZD, and 6185 (29%) on Z‐drugs at baseline]. The median age was 82 years; 81% were female and 94% were non‐Hispanic White. The continuation within 180 days post discharge was 54.9% (95% CI: 54.0%, 55.8%) for short/intermediate‐acting BZD, 58.4% (56.7%, 60.1%) for long‐acting BZD, and 56.0% (54.8%, 57.1%) for Z‐drugs; 7.2%–16.3% refilled with dose reductions. Younger patients or those with anxiety were at higher risk of continuation. Conclusions: A large proportion of US older adults on BZD or Z‐drugs before hospitalization for a hip fracture continued the drugs within 180 days post hospital discharge. This highlights the need for comprehensive medication review and deprescribing intervention during transitions of care in this high‐risk population.

Tools for Acute Care for Elders Risk Score: A Practical Machine Learning–Based Tool for Screening High-Risk Older Inpatients.

Acute Care for Elders Risk Score: A Practical Machine Learning–Based Tool for Screening High-Risk Older Inpatients.
By:Ji, Sunghwan;Jang, Geon Young;Baek, Ji Yeon;+5 moreIn:Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, Oct2025, volume 26, issue 10, page N.PAGCINAHL
To develop and validate a machine learning–based risk score—the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Risk Score—that integrates the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) with readily available clinical and laboratory data to predict adverse outcomes in older hospitalized patients. A retrospective cohort study using a machine learning framework (AutoScore) to develop an interpretable clinical risk score. This study included 21,757 hospital admissions of patients aged ≥65 years at a tertiary academic hospital between May 2021 and November 2023. The patients were randomly allocated to training (50%), test (45%), and validation (5%) cohorts. Eighteen candidate variables were extracted from electronic medical records (EMRs) on the first day of admission. The composite outcome included in-hospital delirium, pressure ulcers, falls, and mortality. Using the AutoScore framework, a parsimonious model with 5 variables (CFS, albumin, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and number of pre-admission medications) was selected. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared with CFS and age. The ACE Risk Score showed superior predictive performance for the composite outcome [area under the curve (AUC) 0.837] compared with CFS alone (AUC 0.798) and age (AUC 0.630; P <.001 for both). Higher ACE scores were also associated with greater risks of safety events, 30-day readmissions and emergency visits after discharge, longer hospital stays, and rapid response team activations. The ACE Risk Score is a practical, interpretable, and scalable tool for early identification of high-risk older inpatients, using data available on the first day of admission. It supports timely, targeted interventions by geriatric teams. The score may facilitate broader implementation of risk-guided care strategies for older adults in hospital settings.

Leading health organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, followed by the gradual introduction of complementary foods. Evidence shows that breastfeeding offers numerous benefits for newborns, mothers, society as a whole, and the environment. Current breastfeeding rates fall below the established recommendations. This study aims to describe breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge and one month postpartum, analyze fluctuations in feeding types during this period, and identify any characteristics, preventive factors, and barriers to breastfeeding and mixed feeding. Methods: This is a multicenter observational study in the North Metropolitan area of Barcelona, with 411 participants surveyed by midwives. Results: In total, 79% of women were exclusively breastfeeding, 14% practiced mixed breastfeeding, and 7% used formula feeding at hospital discharge. At one month postpartum, these rates fluctuated to 64%, 23%, and 13%, respectively. Factors such as older age, having a university education, having 16 weeks of parental leave, and having a foreign-born status were positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding, while mental illness was associated with a lower prevalence. The use of breastfeeding accessories was not significantly associated with fluctuations in feeding type, but it was associated with maintaining mixed feeding. Conclusions: It is essential to implement individual and community interventions, educate healthcare professionals on factors that hinder breastfeeding, and promote workplace policies that support breastfeeding.

Tools for Traumatic spinal injury epidemiology in a Danish population: a retrospective review of prospectively collected data.

Traumatic spinal injury epidemiology in a Danish population: a retrospective review of prospectively collected data.
By:Zielinski, Oliver;Bech, Rune;Gehrchen, Martin;+1 moreIn:Injury Epidemiology, 09/30/2025, volume 12, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Epidemiological data and demographics of spinal injuries are varied; previous studies mainly focus on specific injuries or population subgroups. This study assesses the overall incidence and demographic distribution of traumatic spinal injuries in the Capital Region of Denmark to identify current trends. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study using prospectively collected electronic health record data. All patients with traumatic spinal injuries referred to Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, were prospectively registered during a two-year period. Gender, age, trauma mechanism, neurological injury, associated injuries and choice of treatment were collected from the patient's electronic health record at time of registration. Results: A total of 950 patients were registered, sustaining 1,553 injuries of the spine. Almost 60% of injuries were sustained due to high-energy trauma, the majority of which were incurred by patients < 65 years of age. The age-standardized incidence rate of spinal cord injury was 1.2 per 100,000 persons per year. Surgical intervention was performed on 28.5% of injuries, with significantly lower rates among older adults (p-value < 0.001). Low-energy falls accounted for approximately one-third of injuries, predominantly affecting patients aged 65 and older, representing a modest increase compared to earlier reports. Conclusion: High-energy trauma remains a leading cause of spinal injuries in individuals under 65. Spinal injuries due to low-energy falls are becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly, though surgical management of these injuries remains below the rates associated with younger patient groups. The findings underscore evolving demographic trends and may inform future research into treatment strategies and outcomes, particularly in older populations.

Tools for Inpatient Trauma Care Costs in the US From 2012 to 2021.

Inpatient Trauma Care Costs in the US From 2012 to 2021.
By:Coaston, Troy N.;Cho, Nam Yong;Vadlakonda, Amulya;+6 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 09/23/2025, volume 8, issue 9, page e2533204CINAHL
Key Points: Question: What trends and factors were associated with inpatient trauma care costs in the US from 2012 to 2021? Findings: This cohort study of 18 353 296 hospitalizations found that national inpatient trauma costs nearly doubled over 10 years, with geriatric falls being the primary factor. Geographic and demographic disparities associated with higher costs were motor vehicle collisions, Black race, and care delivered in the Pacific region. Meaning: These findings suggest that with rising trauma-related costs, cost-saving strategies are needed to target inefficiencies and disparities within trauma systems to ensure sustainable and equitable care. This cohort study examines the trends in US inpatient trauma care costs from 2012 to 2021 and identifies patient and hospital factors associated with contemporary costs. Importance: Trauma care, with its inherent complexity and unpredictability, substantially contributes to health care costs in the US. Understanding temporal trends and associated factors may inform targeted cost-mitigation strategies. Objective: To examine trends in trauma-related inpatient costs from 2012 to 2021 and identify patient and hospital factors associated with contemporary costs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the 2012-2021 National Inpatient Sample, which captures 97% of US hospitalizations. Hospitalization for traumatic injuries were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes for external causes of injury. The data analysis was performed between September 2 and October 28, 2024. Exposure: External causes of traumatic injury. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was temporal trends in annual and per-patient hospitalization costs. Additionally, risk-adjusted associations of patient and hospital characteristics with inpatient costs in 2021 were assessed. Results: A total of 18 353 296 hospitalizations were identified during the study period (median [IQR] patient age ranging from 69 [47-83] years in 2012 to 70 [52-82] years in 2021; proportion of women ranging from 53.2% in 2012 to 50.7% in 2021). When stratifying by mechanism of injury, motor vehicle collisions incurred the highest median inpatient costs ($15 412; IQR, $8718-$29 376), followed by falls ($11 769; IQR, $6930-$19 052), other blunt trauma ($9818; IQR, $5567-$17 488), and penetrating injury ($9669; IQR, $4948-$19 545). In 2021, falls accounted for the largest share of costs (70.0%), while patients aged 75 years or older represented the most costly group (34.8%) and Medicare incurred the highest costs among all payers (52.6%). Annual inpatient trauma care costs increased from $27 billion in 2012 to $42 billion in 2021. Median per-patient costs rose from $10 662 (IQR, $6141-$17930) to $14 124 (IQR, $8249-$23 491). Following risk adjustment (2021), motor vehicle collisions (β = $4735.80; 95% CI, $4337.19-$5134.41 [reference, falls]), Black race (β = $1134.86; 95% CI, $628.07-$1641.67 [reference, White race]), and care in the Pacific region (β = $7763.20; 95% CI, $6176.90-$9350.31 [reference, New England]) were associated with greater hospitalization costs. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that inpatient trauma costs nearly doubled between 2012 and 2021, with geriatric falls a major contributor. Geographic and demographic disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions. Addressing systemic inefficiencies and standardizing care practices are critical to curbing rising costs while ensuring equitable trauma care.

Tools for Unraveling key determinants of cranial decompression in isolated severe traumatic brain injury: insights from a national trauma database.

Unraveling key determinants of cranial decompression in isolated severe traumatic brain injury: insights from a national trauma database.
By:Matsoukas, Stavros;Inzerillo, Sean;Wedderburn, Raymond V.;+3 moreIn:Brain Injury, Sep2025, volume 39, issue 12, pages 1034-1041 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Severe isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a complex and understudied population. Limited evidence exists on predictors of cranial decompression. This study aims to quantify the rate and identify factors associated with cranial decompression in severe isolated TBI using a large national database. Methods: Data from the 2019–2021 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Program was analyzed. Severe TBI was defined as a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3. Demographics, vitals, comorbidities, and in-hospital complications were assessed using multivariable models to identify predictors of cranial decompression. Results: A total of 303,766 adults with severe isolated TBI were included (mean age 59.8; 64.2% male; 75.0% white). Cranial decompression was performed in 13.5% (n = 41,045). Univariate analysis showed significant differences in demographics, mechanism of injury, ICU admission, CT findings, midline shift, cerebral monitoring, blood product use, and complications. Multivariable analysis revealed that males, younger age, falls as the mechanism of injury, higher GCS, ICU admission, CT findings, need for cerebral monitoring, presence of midline shift, thromboembolism prophylaxis, and requirement for blood product transfusions, were strong predictors of cranial decompression. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the independent predictors for the need of cranial decompression in severe isolated TBI patients.

Tools for Daylight Savings Time and Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Daylight Savings Time and Acute Myocardial Infarction.
By:Rymer, Jennifer A.;Li, Shuang;Chiswell, Karen;+6 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 09/09/2025, volume 8, issue 9, page e2530442CINAHL
Key Points: Question: What is the association of daylights savings time (DST) with the incidence and outcomes of myocardial infarction? Findings: In this cross-sectional study of 168 870 patients, no significant differences were found in the incidence rates of acute myocardial infarction in DST weeks compared with the week before or after. Additionally, there were no significant differences in outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and stroke, between these weeks. Meaning: These findings suggest that that there is no significant association between DST and the incidence and outcomes of patients presenting with myocardial infarction. This cross-sectional study examines the incidence of patients presenting with myocardial infarction in the weeks before, during, and after the start and end of daylight savings time. Importance: Previous data suggest that the time changes associated with daylight savings time (DST) may be associated with an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objective: To determine whether the incidence of patients presenting with AMI is greater during the weeks during or after DST and compare the in-hospital clinical events between the week before DST and after DST. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study examined patients enrolled in the Chest Pain MI Registry from 2013 to 2022. The study included patients who presented 1 week before DST, during the week of DST, or 1 week after DST (spring or fall) and assessed incidence of AMI, in-hospital mortality, stroke, and clinical outcomes during those times and compared the DST weeks with the week before or after. Data were analyzed from March 2024 to May 2025. Main Outcome and Measure: The main outcome was in-hospital mortality rate. The incidence ratio (IR) of AMI cases was calculated using the observed number of patients with AMI in the DST week divided by the number of patients with AMI who arrived 1 week before or after DST. Results: The final cohort included 168 870 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [56-75] years, 57 023 females [33.8%]; 111 847 males [66.2%]) at 1124 hospitals during the study period. There were 28 678 patients (17.0%) with AMI treated during spring DST, 28 596 (16.9%) the week before, and 28 169 (16.7%) the week after. There were 27 942 patients (16.5%) with AMI treated during fall DST, 27 365 (16.2%) the week before, and 28 120 (16.7%) the week after. Patient characteristics were similar for the spring and fall DST analyses (spring and fall DST median [IQR] age across groups: 65 [56-74] years and 65 [56-75] years, respectively), and there were 28 725 females (33.6%) in the spring and 28 298 females (33.9%) in the fall. There was no significant difference in the incidence of AMI for the following time periods: spring DST week vs 1 week prior, spring DST week vs 1 week after, fall DST week vs 1 week prior, and fall DST week vs 1 week after. There were no significant differences in adjusted in-hospital outcomes for the 1 week before or after fall or spring DST. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found no significant difference in the incidence rates of AMI in DST weeks compared with the week before or after. Additionally, there were no differences in in-hospital clinical outcomes.

Tools for The Role of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in Malnutrition Management in Home Care.

The Role of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in Malnutrition Management in Home Care.
By:Lago, Angela;Zamarripa, MariaIn:Journal of the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, 2025 Supplement, volume 125, pages S36-S41CINAHL
Malnutrition is prevalent among hospitalized patients and is associated with increased complications and longer lengths of stay. Unfortunately, malnutrition also can worsen health outcomes postdischarge by contributing to poor wound healing, falls, and higher rates of hospital readmission. Registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) play a pivotal role in treating malnutrition by advocating for postdischarge care, developing programs that support patients with malnutrition in the home, and providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) to ensure adequate nutrition postdischarge. Community outreach and home-based programs allow RDNs the opportunity to provide postdischarge care for individuals diagnosed with or at risk of malnutrition. By providing in-home or virtual support, RDNs can help align postdischarge nutrition plans with patients' functional and financial needs and connect them to community resources. However, implementing these services presents financial and operational challenges that decision-makers must navigate. Despite these challenges, several organizations have begun leading the way in expanding access to postdischarge nutrition care to improve patient outcomes.

Tools for Preoperative Factors Associated With Falls Following Total Hip Arthroplasty in Older Adults.

Preoperative Factors Associated With Falls Following Total Hip Arthroplasty in Older Adults.
By:Hensley, Craig P.;Kho, Abel N.;Kritselis, Andrew;+3 moreIn:ACR Open Rheumatology, Sep2025, volume 7, issue 9, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Objective: Falls are common after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and can cause serious complications. Understanding preoperative factors linked to falls post‐THA can inform discharge planning and management to lower fall risk. We aimed to identify preoperative factors associated with falls occurring within one year following THA in older adults. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using records within a large hospital system. Adults aged ≥65 years with a recorded THA between March 2012 and March 2022 were included. The primary outcome was a fall occurrence (yes vs no) within one year post‐THA. A fall was identified through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision codes, documentation for fall‐related emergency room visit(s), or mention of a fall in the medical record. Purposeful selection of variables in logistic regression models identified preoperative factors associated with a fall. Results: Among 4,501 patients (age 72.7 ± 6.0 years), 683 (15.2%) experienced at least one fall within one year post‐THA. The strongest risk factors were a fall within one year pre‐THA (odds ratio [OR] = 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.22–3.22) and depression (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.62–2.35). Other factors included neurologic conditions, insomnia, revision or conversion hip arthroplasty, knee pain, lumbar conditions, body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/m2, and older age. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 was protective against falls. Conclusion: This longitudinal cohort study identified multiple independent factors associated with fall occurrences within one year post‐THA. Findings highlight the opportunity to address modifiable factors and provide individuals with tailored discharge planning and management strategies (eg, fall prevention programs) to reduce fall risk.

Retrospective multi-centre cohort study of polypharmacy, the Drug Burden Index and associations with outcomes in older surgical inpatients.
By:Liu, Bonnie Mengyuan;Fujita, Kenji;Thillainadesan, Janani;+2 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Sep2025, volume 54, issue 9, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
Background Comprehensive medication utilisation and its association with outcomes are not well described in older surgical inpatients. Objectives Investigate medication utilisation and the associations of the number of medications and exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medications measured using the Drug Burden Index (DBI exposure) with outcomes in older surgical inpatients. Methods A multi-centre retrospective cohort study of surgical patients ≥65 years at five Australian hospitals admitted for ≥48 hours, from 4 January 2022 to 3 January 2023. The number of regular medications was counted on admission and discharge. DBI exposure throughout admission was calculated using the area under the curve for DBI/days of admission (AUC DBI/days). Multilevel regression was conducted for outcomes on/during admission [falls, adverse drug events (ADEs), delirium, pressure ulcers, Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), length of stay (LOS)]. Results The 13 815 participants (51.1% male) had a median (IQR) age of 77 (71–84) years. The median number of medications was 5 (2–9) on admission and 9 (6–13) on discharge. The median AUC DBI/days was 0.13 (0–0.5). The number of admission medications was associated with delirium [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04], ADEs (aOR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04), pressure ulcers (aOR 1.04, 95% CI:1.02–1.06), HFRS [adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 1.01, 95% CI:1.001–1.02] and increased LOS (aRR 1.011, 95% CI: 1.008–1.014). The AUC DBI/days was associated with falls (aOR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18–1.41), delirium (aOR 1.63, 95% CI:1.46–1.82), ADEs (aOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11–1.43), pressure ulcers (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.38–1.86), HFRS (aRR 1.27, 95% CI:1.17–1.37) and increased LOS (aRR 1.36, 95% CI:1.32–1.40). Conclusion Polypharmacy is common amongst older surgical inpatients, and the number of medications increased from admission to discharge. Increased DBI exposure was associated with adverse outcomes.

Tools for Impact of "The Pause" on the Code Blue Team and Exploration of Witnessing Death.

Impact of "The Pause" on the Code Blue Team and Exploration of Witnessing Death.
By:Samai, Kathryn;Bonamer, Jennifer;Ziegler, Shannon;+1 moreIn:American Journal of Critical Care, Sep2025, volume 34, issue 5, pages 346-353 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Experiencing a patient's death after a resuscitation effort can be emotionally traumatizing to health care professionals. In a large community teaching hospital, the code blue team implemented "The Pause" as a coping strategy to support the well-being of the interprofessional health care team. Objectives: To assess the impact of the Pause on compassion fatigue, distress, and mindfulness and to explore clinicians' experiences with patients' death after a code blue event and use of the Pause. Methods: This multimethod study included preimplementation and postimplementation surveys and interviews of clinical and nonclinical health care staff who respond to house-wide code blue events. Results: The Pause intervention was implemented in fall 2021; 64 preimplementation surveys were collected in May 2021, and 74 postimplementation surveys were collected in August 2022. Compassion fatigue scores decreased after implementation, and mindfulness scores increased; however, neither change was statistically significant. During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants reported more distress from patient deaths after a code blue event. Qualitative interviews yielded themes such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on death, emotionally coping with death, and the Pause as humanizing. Conclusions: The Pause was perceived as a helpful coping strategy for code blue–related patient death; however, the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult to measure intervention effects. The Pause may also offer an opportunity to support and empower health care professionals during an impactful moment, such as witnessing death.

Tools for Screening and assessment of falls risk in the emergency department.

Screening and assessment of falls risk in the emergency department.
By:Fulbrook, Paul;Miles, Sandra J.;Jordan, Faye;+2 moreIn:Australasian Emergency Care, Sep2025, volume 28, issue 3, pages 179-185 (7p)CINAHL
Falls are a source of harm, repeat emergency department visits and hospital admission for older adults. Undertaking a comprehensive geriatric screening including falls-risk is recommended in guidelines for optimal older adult emergency department care. A pragmatic prospective cohort study was undertaken to evaluate use of further falls-risk screening in older adults in a large tertiary Australian hospital emergency department. Primary outcome measures of interest were length of stay; discharge destination; 30-day and 90-day re-presentations. Of 651 eligible cases, 320 were randomly recruited for further screening following consent. The implementation cohort spent an average 45 m longer in the emergency department with a greater proportion admitted to the short stay unit, staying there longer than a comparison cohort. There were significantly fewer 30-day fall-related representations (2.9 %) in the implementation cohort. Despite a small reduction in emergency department re-presentation within 30 days in the implementation cohort, hospital admission was not reduced. Further research is needed to examine any cost-benefit ratio of additional falls-risk screening and intervention in emergency departments.

Tools for Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults in the community.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults in the community.
By:O'Hare, Allison;Harrison, Joanna;Hill, JamesIn:British Journal of Community Nursing, Sep2025, volume 30, issue 9, pages 420-425 (6p)CINAHL
With more than 11 million community-dwelling older adults in England and Wales, and one in four having two or more long-term conditions, the need to help older people to remain healthy and well is a priority. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is identified as a gold standard for improving outcomes for older adults in a hospital setting and is recommended for older adult inpatients. However, knowledge gaps remain on comprehensive geriatric assessment conducted in a community setting. This commentary critically appraises a systematic integrated review that synthesises the evidence for conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults in a community setting on health outcomes, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation.

Tools for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment of Older Patients with Multiple Myeloma: A Prospective Observational Study.

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment of Older Patients with Multiple Myeloma: A Prospective Observational Study.
By:Sobrini-Morillo, Paula;Corral-Tuesta, Celia;Sánchez-Castellano, Carmen;+6 moreIn:Cancers, Sep2025, volume 17, issue 17, page 2904CINAHL
Simple Summary: This study explored the use of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in older adults newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma at an academic hospital in Madrid, Spain. A total of 55 patients were assessed at diagnosis, and one year later. Geriatric syndromes—including malnutrition, polypharmacy, and frailty—were highly prevalent. Although frailty status varied depending on the tool used, significant improvements were observed after one year of treatment. Frail patients were at increased risk for both grade 3–5 hematologic toxicity and mortality. These findings support the feasibility and clinical value of integrated onco-hematogeriatric care models, which facilitate multidimensional assessment and help tailor treatment strategies for vulnerable patients. Background/Objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) predominantly affects older adults, a heterogeneous population. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and abbreviated tools support individualized treatment planning. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of CGA and its impact on clinical outcomes in this subgroup of patients. Methods: Prospective, observational, and single-center study including patients aged ≥65 years assessed at MM diagnosis and one year later in an onco-hematogeriatrics clinic. A CGA was performed, and frailty was evaluated using the following: G8, Geriatric Assessment in Hematology (GAH), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Frail-VIG Index (FI-VIG), modified Fried phenotype, International Myeloma Working Group Frailty Index (IMWG-FI), and Revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index (R-MCI). At one year, patients were reassessed; treatment response (IMWG criteria), adverse events (CTCAE v5.03), and mortality were recorded. Results: Fifty-five patients (mean age 78.0 ± 5.4 years, 58.2% female) diagnosed between December 2019 and May 2024 were included. CGA completion exceeded 90% at both time points. At one year, 9 patients (16.4%) had died, and 16 (29.1%) achieved complete response, with daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (DRd) being the most used regimen. Frailty prevalence significantly declined (FRAIL: p = 0.012; CFS: p = 0.016; IMWG-FI: p = 0.020). GAH was significantly associated with ≥grade 3 hematologic toxicity (OR = 5.67, p = 0.004) and mortality (AUC = 0.750, p = 0.027). FI-VIG also predicted mortality (OR = 14.67, p = 0.026). Conclusions: CGA and its abbreviated forms are feasible and clinically valuable tools for identifying vulnerable older adults with MM, enabling treatment individualization and improved risk stratification.

Tools for Knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome Among Polish Nurses and Midwives: A Cross-Sectional National Survey.

Knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome Among Polish Nurses and Midwives: A Cross-Sectional National Survey.
By:Głowińska, Alina;Glowinski, SebastianIn:Children, Sep2025, volume 12, issue 9, page 1160CINAHL
Highlights: 94.5% of nurses had heard of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS), but only 5.5% received formal training; 27.3% experienced emotional overload while caring for a crying infant; Older nurses showed better knowledge of colic and safer coping strategies; 92.7% expressed interest in SBS and infant crying management training; Only 29.1% believed mothers are informed about SBS in maternity wards. Background: Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is a severe form of abusive head trauma with potentially fatal consequences. Nurses and midwives play a crucial role in its prevention through early recognition and caregiver education; however, little is known about their knowledge and preparedness in the Polish context. Objectives: To assess the knowledge, perceptions, and educational experiences related to SBS among Polish nurses and midwives working with infants. Participants and Setting: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among 110 nurses and midwives employed in neonatal and pediatric care settings across Poland. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire collected demographic data and evaluated knowledge of SBS, infant crying, coping strategies, and prior training. Associations between knowledge levels and participant characteristics were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Most participants (94.5%) had heard of SBS, and 78.2% correctly recognized shaking as more dangerous than a fall from a changing table. However, only 5.5% reported receiving formal training on SBS. Recognition of SBS symptoms was generally high (e.g., vomiting 100%, seizures 90.9%), but misconceptions persisted regarding coping with infant crying. More than one-quarter (27.3%) admitted experiencing a "breaking point," and this group was more likely to acknowledge the risk of losing emotional control. Older nurses demonstrated significantly better recognition of crying patterns and colic (p = 0.0415), while SBS knowledge was positively associated with years of professional experience (p = 0.0484). Conclusions: Although general awareness of SBS is widespread, practical knowledge and training remain insufficient. Structured educational programs on SBS and infant crying management are urgently needed to better prepare healthcare professionals and reduce the risk of caregiver-related harm to infants.

Background: Serious healthcare–associated infections (HAIs) are adverse events where early detection is important to mitigate negative consequences for patients. Objectives: To explore the experiences of health care professionals in surgical and intensive care regarding serious HAIs and factors facilitating or hindering early detection. Methods: Qualitative study with a descriptive design. Thirty-four assistant nurses, registered nurses, and physicians in surgical wards or intensive care units in 4 hospitals were recruited through purposive sampling, and interviewed in 10 focus groups. Data were analyzed according to Krueger and Casey. Results: The analyses revealed the overarching theme a puzzle to solve , describing the complexity of factors that need to fall into place to achieve early detection. The puzzle is described with 4 categories, different perspectives on serious HAIs , considering the risk of infection , connecting the pieces , and detecting the deteriorating patient. Conclusion: Early detection of serious HAIs is multifactorial, depending on the patient's condition, standards, and routines in clinical practice, but also related to an organizational level. The next step should be to develop and test a decision support system with the intention to detect signs and symptoms at an early stage in the clinical context.

Assessment of physical frailty in older inpatients with heart failure: A screening proposal.
By:Mayoral-Testón, Nadia;Vázquez-Jarén, Elena;Fernandez-Morillo, Inmaculada;+5 moreIn:Geriatric Nursing, Sep2025, volume 65, page N.PAGCINAHL
• Inpatients with heart failure have a high degree of physical frailty and risk of falls. • We need multidisciplinary teams to better assessment of frailty in HF. • Frail scale is very easy to complete; it's a very useful tool for screening frail patients. Identifying the prevalence of physical frailty in patients aged 65 years and over admitted to hospital with heart failure. Secondary objective: determining the usefulness of the FRAIL scale as a screening tool. Observational and cross-sectional study. Includes patients aged 65 years and over hospitalised consecutively with heart failure over one year. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. The Fried Phenotype, FRAIL scale and SPPB scale were used as physical frailty scales. 253 patients were included. Fried Phenotype, FRAIL scale and SPPB scale show a high prevalence of frailty, and a risk of falls associated with frailty (83.3 %, 76.1 % and 95.9 %, respectively). The prevalence of physical frailty and the risk of falls in patients admitted to hospital for heart failure aged 65 years or over is very high. FRAIL scale is a very good option as a frailty screening tool. [Display omitted]

Tools for Construction and validation of nomogram to predict the frailty risk of senile stroke patients.

Construction and validation of nomogram to predict the frailty risk of senile stroke patients.
By:Kong, Linghui;Zhang, Huijun;Jiang, PengIn:Geriatric Nursing, Sep2025, volume 65, page N.PAGCINAHL
• This study analyzed the influencing factors of frailty in elderly stroke patients. • The predictive model of frailty risk established has good predictive effect. • This model is conducive to early detection of frailty high-risk groups. • The model can guide the medical staff to take targeted treatment measures. Senile stroke patients with frailty are more likely to have adverse clinical outcomes such as falls, disability and re-admission. Severe frailty may even lead to death. Therefore, early identification of frailty and targeted intervention measures will help to reduce or delay the occurrence and development of frailty in senile stroke patients and avoid related adverse outcomes. From September 2022 to March 2023, 415 senile stroke patients from a hospital in Liaoning Province were selected by convenient sampling method. Collect data through questionnaire survey, screen the independent influencing factors of patients' frailty, use R software to draw the nomogram of multivariate logistic regression model, and verify the model according to the area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curve and clinical decision curve (DCA). A total of 415 participants were collected, and the incidence of frailty was 72.5 %. Impaired ADL (OR=5.713, 95 %CI: 1.296–25.194), frequency of incidence(OR=4.694, 95 %CI: 1.505–14.64), anxiety (OR=17.398, 95 %CI: 4.251–71.214), depression(OR=5.578, 95 %CI: 1.659–18.752) and abnormal nutritional status (OR=6.335, 95 %CI: 1.69–23.74) were independent risk factors for senile stroke patients, and social support (OR=0.826, 95 %CI: 0.773–0.882) was protective factor. AUC is 0.957 (95 %CI: 0.967–0.989). The calibration curve shows that the calibration curve fits the ideal curve. The clinical decision curve shows that this model has good clinical practicability. The frail risk prediction model of senile stroke patients established in this study has a good prediction effect, which is conducive to early detection of frail high-risk groups, so as to guide medical personnel to take targeted treatment measures to reduce the incidence of frailty.

Tools for Prioritizing care and addressing distinct needs of older adults with disabilities in Ghana amidst challenges.

Prioritizing care and addressing distinct needs of older adults with disabilities in Ghana amidst challenges.
By:Osei, Evans Appiah;Addasah, Felicia;Oware, Jenifer;+5 moreIn:Geriatric Nursing, Sep2025, volume 65, page N.PAGCINAHL
• What is already known • Older adults globally encounter significant barriers to healthcare, social support, and economic inclusion. • The caregiving burden for older adults often falls on families and healthcare providers, especially in low-resource settings. • Enhancing the quality of life for older adults remains a critical public health objective. • What this study contributes • Reinforces the importance of preserving autonomy and independence among older adults with disabilities. • Demonstrates how social roles—such as grandparent caregiving support enchance engagement and their mental well-being. • Reveals systemic challenges in Ghana, including limited access to mobility aids, geriatric-specific care facilities, and trained personnel. • Advocates for comprehensive structural reforms, including policy improvements, geriatric training, and public awareness efforts, to ensure equitable and safe care for older adults with disabilities in resource-constrained environments. Older adults with disabilities face major barriers to quality healthcare, including chronic conditions, mental health issues, and cognitive impairments yet their needs are often overlooked. This study examined experiences of nurses in Ghana caring for older adults with disabilities. A qualitative descriptive design was used. Researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with 40 nurses in two hospitals in Accra, Ghana. Data were transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Nurses viewed aging as natural and rejected negative attitudes toward older adults. The findings also revealed several ways of prioritizing and caring for older with disabilities. Nurses help bridge care gaps by promoting autonomy and challenging ageism for older adults with disability. However, systemic changes are needed for sustained impact. Key challenges include limited resources, lack of geriatric services for older adults with disabilities, and misconceptions about aging. Addressing these requires better training, funding, awareness, and policy reform.

Análisis de caídas en pacientes hospitalizados: estudio observacional descriptivo retrospectivo en Clínic Barcelona – Sede Plató.
By:Pérez-de-Gracia, David;Luz Jordán, Silvia;Fornieles Moreira, Margarita;+1 moreIn:Gerokomos, Sep2025, volume 36, issue 3, pages 177-182 (6p)CINAHL
Objective: To analyse the number of falls and associated circumstances in 4 hospitalization units of internal medicine and geriatrics, during the year 2023. Methodology: Retrospective descriptive observational retrospective study conducted during 2023 in 4 internal medicine and geriatrics units. We used clinical records and reports, internal database and collected demographic data, clinical conditions, risk factors to develop subsequent prevention strategies to improve patient safety during hospital admission. Results: The data analyzed showed that the risk of falls increases with age, especially after 80 years of age, corroborating the data obtained from the Downton scale. Of the 88 falls recorded, the main causes included alterations in cognitive status (26.63%), mobility problems (20.11%) and weakness or incontinence (16.85%). Among the elements of the environment that contributed to falls, beds (22.61%), bathrooms (18.26%) and inappropriate footwear (16.52%) stood out. Loss of balance was the most common reason, with 48.86%, followed by slipping (29.55%) and tripping (14.77%). These findings suggested that preventive measures should focus on improving balance, ensuring safe surfaces and removing obstacles in the environment, especially for people over 80 years of age with mobility and cognitive problems, who are at greater risk of suffering an in-hospital fall. Conclusions: Prevention of falls in frail elderly is essential in internal medicine and geriatrics. This prevention involves constant vigilance, modification of the physical environment and supervision of care activities. Appropriate interventions not only improve clinical outcomes but also reduce complications during hospital admission. A multifactorial approach is crucial to decrease the risk of falls, improve safety during admission and optimize the perceived quality of life of our elders. This approach should include physical exercise, environmental adjustments and comprehensive medication assessment. In addition, there was evidence of the need to adapt the hospital environment, improve supervision of care activities and encourage physical rehabilitation to mitigate the risks associated with falls.

Tools for Patient safety management activities and perceived workload of shift‐work nurses, moderated by the perceived importance of patient safety management.

Patient safety management activities and perceived workload of shift‐work nurses, moderated by the perceived importance of patient safety management.
By:Hong, Kyung JinIn:International Nursing Review, Sep2025, volume 72, issue 3, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Aim: To explore the relationship between patient safety management and each aspect of nurses' workload and to report the moderating effects of the perceived importance of patient safety management on these relationships. Background: As the importance of patient safety is emphasized, nurses' work demands, including patient identification, infection control, and prevention of falls and pressure ulcers, are increasing. However, differences according to hospital type and nurses' increased workload have not been considered when measuring nurses' workload. Methods: This study used a cross‐sectional research design and an online survey, adhering to the STROBE reporting guidelines. The study population consisted of 215 shift‐work nurses employed in tertiary or general hospitals in Korea. Data were collected in January 2024. Results: Patient safety management activities had a positive effect on the pace and amount of work, emotional workload, and mental workload, and a negative effect on work organization (interruption). The perceived importance of patient safety management negatively moderated the effects of perceived patient safety management activities on emotional workload and work organization. Conclusion: This study clarifies the relationship between patient safety activities and each aspect of nurses' workload. The additional demands on nurses due to patient safety management activities should be considered when measuring their workloads and determining adequate nurse staffing levels. Implications for nursing and health policy: To manage the burden of nurses' work demands effectively, it is essential to maintain adequate staffing levels and continuously monitor the patient safety climate. This approach will increase nurses' perception of the importance of patient safety management. Continuous education on patient safety should also be provided.

Tools for Nurse‐sensitive quality and benchmarking in hospitals striving for Magnet® or Pathway® designation: A qualitative study.

Nurse‐sensitive quality and benchmarking in hospitals striving for Magnet® or Pathway® designation: A qualitative study.
By:Maier, Claudia B.;Gurisch, Carolin;Köppen, Julia;+2 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Sep2025, volume 81, issue 9, pages 5484-5496 (13p)CINAHL
Aim: To examine if and how selected German hospitals use nurse‐sensitive clinical indicators and perspectives on national/international benchmarking. Design: Qualitative study. Methods: In 2020, 18 expert interviews were conducted with key informants from five purposively selected hospitals, being the first in Germany implementing Magnet® or Pathway®. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis with deductive‐inductive coding. The study followed the COREQ guideline. Results: Three major themes emerged: first, limited pre‐existence of and necessity for nurse‐sensitive data. Although most interviewees reported data collection for hospital‐acquired pressure ulcers and falls with injuries, implementation varied and interviewees highlighted the necessity to develop additional nurse‐sensitive indicators for the German context. Second, the theme creating an enabling data environment comprised building clinicians' acceptance, establishing a data culture, and reducing workload by using electronic health records. Third, challenges and opportunities in establishing benchmarking were identified but most interviewees called for a national or European benchmarking system. Conclusion: The need for further development of nurse‐sensitive clinical indicators and its implementation in practice was highlighted. Several actions were suggested at hospital level to establish an enabling data environment in clinical care, including a nationwide or European benchmarking system. Implications for the Profession and Patient Care: Involving nurses in data collection, comparison and benchmarking of nurse‐sensitive indicators and their use in practice can improve quality of patient care. Impact: Nurse‐sensitive indicators were rarely collected, and a need for action was identified. The study results show research needs on nurse‐sensitive indicators for Germany and Europe. Measures were identified to create an enabling data environment in hospitals. An initiative was started in Germany to establish a nurse‐sensitive benchmarking capacity. Patient or Public Contribution: Clinical practitioners and nurse/clinical managers were interviewed.

Tools for Falls in Hospitals: Challenging Traditional Risk Assessments With New Insights Into Patient Mobility.

Falls in Hospitals: Challenging Traditional Risk Assessments With New Insights Into Patient Mobility.
By:Hoyer, Erik H.;Young, Daniel L.;Zhang, Chi;+2 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Sep2025, volume 81, issue 9, pages 5824-5830 (7p)CINAHL
Aims and Objectives: To explore the association between different aspects of patient functional mobility, specifically, mobility capability (i.e., what the patients could do) versus mobility performance (i.e., what the patients actually did) and hospital falls. Background: Fall risk assessments are important strategies to mitigate inpatient falls, and mobility is a crucial factor in determining a patient's risk. However, different fall assessment tools vary in how they attribute risk based on mobility difficulties. Understanding how various aspects of mobility uniquely influence fall risk is essential for accurately capturing and assessing a patient's true fall risk. Design: A retrospective analysis was conducted using routine electronic medical record data at three hospitals, encompassing 498 patients who experienced falls and 53,708 patients who did not fall. Methods: We examined patient mobility in three distinct ways and their relationship with in‐hospital falls. Mobility was assessed within the first 48 h of admission using the mobility questions in the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT). Additionally, we evaluated other aspects of mobility using the AM‐PAC scale, which measures mobility capability, and the JH‐HLM scale, which assesses mobility performance. Results: A negative linear/stepwise relationship was observed between both AM‐PAC scores and JHFRAT mobility scores with fall incidence, indicating that lower mobility capability is consistently linked to a higher risk of falls. In contrast, the relationship between JH‐HLM scores and falls followed an inverse U‐shaped curve, with a lower fall incidence in patients with the lowest mobility performance. Conclusions: This exploratory study highlights that a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to assessing mobility may not accurately capture a patient's true fall risk, emphasising the importance of evaluating different aspects of patient mobility for a more precise assessment. By considering both functional mobility capacity and actual mobility performance, we can better understand and address the unique ways in which mobility impacts fall risk.

Tools for Surgical treatment of chronic exertional compartment syndrome – A flash in the pan?

Surgical treatment of chronic exertional compartment syndrome – A flash in the pan?
By:Lin, Charles C.;Kirschner, Noah;Samuel, Zachariah;+3 moreIn:Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies, Sep2025, volume 43, pages 279-283 (5p)CINAHL
To quantify the changes in incidence and procedural volume of elective fasciotomies for chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) in New York State from 2010 to 2018, identifying key demographic and geographic contributors to these trends. Retrospective epidemiological study. The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) was queried for patients who underwent outpatient fasciotomy procedures between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018 for CECS. Yearly outpatient fasciotomy volumes were the main outcome measures, and secondary measures included patient age, the year of surgery, hospital location, and hospital volume. In addition, a literature search of all primary literature on CECS during the study period was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases. An increased incidence in fasciotomies was identified between 2012 and 2015 compared to those years before and after. Following a steep rise peaking at more than 700 cases in 2013 from an initial incidence of 320 cases in 2010, the number of outpatient fasciotomies has continued to decrease. Additionally, the rise and fall of fasciotomy procedures over this period appears to have been driven predominantly by procedures performed at higher-volume facilities, and in patients greater than 45 years old. High-volume facilities were geographically located near large metropolitan areas. Primary publications on CECS followed a similar trend to the incidence of fasciotomies. Popularity of fasciotomies for CECS was transient, driven by more procedures in older patients and high-volume facilities in urban areas. Publication trends and literature targeted at older populations may have influenced procedural incidence.

Breaking the Ice: Are Online Patient Educational Materials on Breast Cryoablation Readable and Understandable?
By:Kidanemariam, Simon;Lopez, Antonio R;Baird, Grayson L;+4 moreIn:Journal of Breast Imaging, Sep/Oct2025, volume 7, issue 5, pages 564-575 (12p)CINAHL
Objective Online patient education materials (OPEMs) provide valuable information on breast-related conditions and treatment options. We evaluated commonly accessed OPEMs related to breast cryoablation to assess the readability, understandability, and actionability metrics of educational materials available to patients. Methods Using Google, the terms "breast cryoablation," "breast cryosurgery," and "breast cryotherapy" were queried. The top 50 websites providing OPEMs for the general public were identified by search ranking. A virtual private network was used, and location tracking, cookies, and user account information were disabled before querying. Sponsored content and research journal articles were excluded. Websites were categorized as academic/hospital, commercial, or nonprofit based on the hosting organization. Online patient education materials from the top 50 sites were downloaded and assessed for readability, understandability, and actionability. Mixed modeling, with sources nested within readability scores (automated readability, Coleman-Liau, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), was used to evaluate these metrics. Results Among 52 websites, the overall mean grade-level readability was 12.3 (95% CI, 11.1-13.6). Academic/hospital sites had the lowest readability at 11.8, followed by nonprofit at 12.4 and commercial at 12.7 (P = .03). The mean understandability score was 71%, with academic/hospital sites at 81%, commercial at 73%, and nonprofit at 25%. Only 2 websites—Serenity Surgery and Cleveland Clinic—demonstrated actionability. Overall actionability was 18.5% (95% CI, 7.5%-38.9%), with 24 websites scoring 0% for actionability. Conclusion Current OPEMs concerning breast cryoablation fall short of the American Medical Association's recommendations for health literacy, averaging twice that level. Additionally, there is significant variability in the materials' understandability and actionability.

Tools for Prevalence and Influence Factors of Cognitive Frailty in the Older Adult Patients Undergoing Maintenance Haemodialysis: A Multi‐Centre Cross‐Sectional Study.

Prevalence and Influence Factors of Cognitive Frailty in the Older Adult Patients Undergoing Maintenance Haemodialysis: A Multi‐Centre Cross‐Sectional Study.
By:Li, Siyu;Huang, Li;Wang, Wenmian;+1 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Sep2025, volume 34, issue 9, pages 3693-3703 (11p)CINAHL
Aims: To examine the prevalence of factors of cognitive frailty in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis (MHD). Design: A cross‐sectional study. Methods: From September 2023 to January 2024, 1023 patients undergoing MHD were recruited from 11 hospitals in Chengdu, China, using convenience sampling. The participants' sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, health information and laboratory indicators were assessed using a general information questionnaire. Cognitive frailty was assessed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scales. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the associations between cognitive frailty and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Independent variables for the multivariate logistic regression model encompassing age, sex, educational level, marital status, visual impairment, hearing impairment, falls within a year, depression, weight, height, Malnutrition‐inflammation score and serum albumin, sodium, phosphorus, total cholesterol and creatinine levels. Results: Among 1023 participants with a mean age of 69.52 years, 300 (29.3%) had cognitive frailty, with a predominance of older patients. Regression analysis showed that advanced age, low literacy and low serum creatinine, sodium and total cholesterol levels were positively correlated with cognitive frailty. Furthermore, 17.1% of the participants experienced depression, a risk factor for cognitive frailty, and malnutrition was an independent risk factor for cognitive frailty. Conclusion: Older adult patients undergoing (MHD) are at an increased risk of developing cognitive frailty. The aetiology of cognitive frailty in this cohort was multifactorial. Targeted interventions should be designed and implemented based on these factors, prioritising nutritional guidance and mood management to prevent or reverse cognitive frailty. Reporting Method: The study adhered to the STROBE checklist. Impact: Older adult patients undergoing MHD are at increased risk of developing cognitive frailty. Cognitive frailty screening must be incorporated into the routine assessment of older patients undergoing MHD. Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public contribution.

Implementation of bedside handover that includes patients or carers in hospital settings: A systematic review.
By:Maher, Amy;Hsu, Henry;Ebrahim, Mohamed Eftal Bin Mohamed;+2 moreIn:Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, Sep2025, volume 31, issue 6, pages 1-15 (15p)CINAHL
Objective: Increasing complexity in healthcare systems necessitates effective handover. While a universal structure is often recommended, many frameworks do not include the patient. A systematic review was completed examining outcomes following handover that included patients or carers using a realist‐orientated paradigm. Methods: The research group used Covidence™ software and followed PRISMA guidelines. A librarian‐led search of Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and SCOPUS yielded 5,790 relevant studies for screening. Included studies reported on peer‐reviewed studies that assessed qualitative or quantitative outcomes resulting from patient‐centred handover. To assess quality, we used the McMaster Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Patient‐orientated and quantitative outcomes are reported descriptively. For qualitative outcomes, we employed a deductive analytical approach. Braun and Clarke's steps were followed to develop themes with group work used to clarify and discuss the various codes. Heterogenous reporting precluded meta‐analysis. Results: Thirty studies were eligible (10 mixed methods; 11 quantitative; 9 qualitative) with variable quality and scope. Most studies related to nursing‐led bedside handover and originated in Anglophone countries. Positive effects were reported for patient satisfaction, engagement, autonomy and effective information exchange. Providers reported a positive experience but also barriers to implementation, cognitive load and reducing compliance over time. There were contradicting findings for patient‐orientated outcomes including falls risk. Publication bias may have led to under reporting of negative trials. There was limited reporting on physician‐led handovers that included patients. Conclusions: Patient‐centred handover was associated with self‐reported benefits for patients and providers but potential advantages over conventional handover could be undermined by barriers such as time, implementation challenges and a perceived increase in staff workload.

Tools for The Incidence and Predictive Factors of Thromboembolism During Hospitalizations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare‐Ups: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Taiwan.

The Incidence and Predictive Factors of Thromboembolism During Hospitalizations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare‐Ups: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Taiwan.
By:Meng, Ming‐Jung;Chung, Chen‐Shuan;Chang, Chen‐Wang;+4 moreIn:Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, Sep2025, volume 31, issue 6, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background/Aims: Thromboembolism (TE) notably increase morbidity and mortality among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Despite ECCO's 2024 guidelines advocating routine anticoagulant prophylaxis, its application in Asia remains inconsistent due to a lack of regional studies. This research investigates the incidence and predictors of TE during IBD‐related hospitalizations in Taiwan, aiming to improve prevention strategies. Materials and Methods: Our retrospective cohort study included 282 adult IBD patients, accounting for 515 flare‐up related hospitalizations at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 2001 to March 2024. Patients were classified into two groups based on the occurrence of TE. Results: The incidence of TE was 1.55%. The TE group had significantly lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin and albumin levels but higher rate of sepsis and concurrent autoimmune diseases compared to the non‐TE group. Multivariate analysis indicated that concurrent autoimmune diseases and hypoalbuminemia were independent predictors of TE. The optimal serum albumin cutoff was established at 3.01 g/dL, with sensitivities and specificities of 87.5% and 77.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This pioneering Asian study identifies concurrent autoimmune diseases and low serum albumin as key predictors of TE in hospitalized IBD patients. We recommend targeted anticoagulant prophylaxis for IBD patients with these risk factors, especially when serum albumin falls below 3.01 g/dL.

Tools for Impact of hospitalists' social identities on perceptions of teamwork.

Impact of hospitalists' social identities on perceptions of teamwork.
By:Herchline, Daniel;Tenney-Soeiro, Rebecca;Mehta, Jay J.In:Journal of Interprofessional Care, Sep/Oct2025, volume 39, issue 5, pages 840-847 (8p)CINAHL
Interprofessional teamwork provides unique opportunities for improving patient care. This study used Social Identity Theory as a conceptual framework to characterize the relationships between the social identities of pediatric hospitalists and their perceptions of interprofessional teamwork. We used qualitative methods including free-listing and semi-structured interviews to examine these relationships. We identified five key themes: (a) Pediatric hospitalists' identities fall along a spectrum ranging from profession-centered to team-centered; (b) Familiarity is conducive to formation of team identity; (c) Co-creation of a shared vision and practice of creating shared mental models strengthens sense of team; (d) Institutional culture acts as both a facilitator for and barrier to formation of team identity; (e) High-functioning teams often epitomize the concept of "flexible leadership." We conclude that Social Identity Theory can be a useful theoretical lens for examining interprofessional teamwork in healthcare settings, including among pediatric hospitalists.

Tools for A Multimodal Fall Prevention Intervention in the Setting of the Emergency Department.

A Multimodal Fall Prevention Intervention in the Setting of the Emergency Department.
By:Niznik, Joshua D.;Small, Cassandra;Kelley, Casey J.;+7 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Sep2025, volume 73, issue 9, pages 2780-2788 (9p)CINAHL
Background: The emergency department (ED) is an opportune setting for fall prevention interventions. We implemented and evaluated a multimodal falls prevention intervention addressing medications, mobility, and functional risk factors among older adults presenting to the ED for fall‐related injuries. Methods: We implemented a quality improvement intervention at two hospitals among ED visits for adults aged 65 and older with a chief complaint of fall between May 2023 and June 2024. The intervention included: (1) medication review by a pharmacist; (2) assessment by physical therapy (PT); and (3) assessment by occupational therapy (OT). We conducted a retrospective evaluation of electronic health records and reported the proportion of patients that received screening along with risk factors, recommendations, adherence to recommendations, and return visits at 3 and 6 months. We used logistic regression to examine factors associated with return visits. Results: We identified 686 older adults who received ≥ 1 screening. Most patients received PT and OT evaluations (94.8% and 93.4%), while fewer (15.2%) received medication reviews. The most common problems identified by PT and OT were fall risk, decreased mobility, and impaired balance. Discharge to a skilled nursing facility was the most common recommendation (55.5% PT, 55.1% OT) followed by home care (33.1% PT, 31.2% OT). High‐risk medications most often identified were anticoagulants, antidepressants, and gabapentin. The most common recommendation was to "discuss with a primary care physician." Among those who received ≥ 1 intervention, 8.9% experienced a return visit within 3 months and 12.8% within 6 months. Inpatient admission was associated with increased likelihood of return visits compared to discharge from the ED. Conclusion: The most prevalent risk factors for falls among older adults presenting to the ED are likely modifiable through PT and OT intervention. Further research is needed to address uptake barriers and longitudinal impact on outcomes.

Background: The emergency department (ED) is the safety net for and a common point of healthcare access for socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults. Little is known about socioeconomically disadvantaged older ED patients' perspectives on their health, healthcare access, and ED use. Such insights could guide tailored interventions to address unmet clinical and health‐related social needs (HRSN). Methods: We performed a qualitative study with older adults in a single public safety net hospital ED. We interviewed patients age 60+ who had ≥ 4 ED 4 visits in the past year. Semi‐structured interviews explored perceived health needs and motivations underlying ED visits. We screened for HRSN using validated measures. We performed content analysis to evaluate key drivers of ED use based on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use and used principles of narrative analysis to identify distinct profiles of older patients with frequent ED use. Results: Among 68 interview participants, 40% identified as Black and 43% as Hispanic. Sixty percent had health insurance. Most participants (63%) reported HRSN, but rarely described these as primary drivers of ED use. Instead, poor access to outpatient care and medical complexity related to condition‐specific needs were the most salient factors. Six distinct profiles emerged of patients who: (1) lacked insurance and primary care; (2) faced an acute condition; (3) held acute concerns related to serious underlying diseases; (4) had chronic disease whose management bordered between outpatient and inpatient settings; (5) had a sentinel event (e.g., fall, surgery) with cascading sequelae; (6) faced recurrent challenges managing indwelling catheters, tubes, and long‐term vascular access. Conclusions: Among socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults in our sample, medical complexity was a more salient driver of frequent ED use than unmet social needs. Innovations to strengthen outpatient care and offer alternatives to ED and hospital admission are needed for this population.

Tools for Deprescribing Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists in Older Adults and People With Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.

Deprescribing Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists in Older Adults and People With Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.
By:McEvoy, Aisling M.;Langford, Aili V.;Liau, Shin J.;+3 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Sep2025, volume 73, issue 9, pages 2905-2913 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) (benzodiazepines and z‐drugs) may provide limited benefits in the management of insomnia when used short‐term. However, they increase the risk of harms including falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and cognitive impairment. Deprescribing (cessation) of BZRAs may be beneficial for older adults and people living with cognitive impairment as they are at heightened risk of adverse events. This review investigated the effects of patient‐directed, non‐pharmacological interventions to support deprescribing of BZRAs used for insomnia in older adults and people living with cognitive impairment. Methods: Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Medline were searched in January 2024 with no publication date restrictions. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments (ROB2 for randomized studies, ROBINS‐I for non‐randomized studies) were conducted independently by two authors. Outcomes of interest included the proportion of participants who ceased BZRAs, reduction in BZRAs, switching to another medication, sleep outcomes, and clinical outcomes. Studies were included if they investigated BZRA deprescribing in older adults (≥ 65 years) or people living with cognitive impairment. Results: Seventeen reports analyzing 16 studies in hospital, community, and aged care settings were included. BZRA cessation rates ranged between 23% to 72% for written education (n = 6); 14% to 57% for combined written and verbal education (n = 5); and 9% to 100% for multi‐component interventions (n = 6). One report investigated a BZRA deprescribing educational intervention in people with cognitive impairment and found comparable effectiveness to participants without cognitive impairment. Most studies were at a high risk of bias. Conclusions: Patient‐directed interventions led to BZRA cessation, although there was significant variability between studies. It is unknown if all interventions examined are similarly effective for people living with cognitive impairment. Further research investigating approaches to deprescribing BZRAs in older adults or people with cognitive impairment is required.

A Cross-Lagged Panel Model Testing the Impact of Physical Activity During Hospitalization on 1- and 6-Month Discharge Physical Activity and Adverse Events Among Older Adults With Dementia.
By:Zhu, Shijun;Resnick, Barbara;Boltz, Marie;+6 moreIn:Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, Sep2025, volume 26, issue 9, page N.PAGCINAHL
The objective of this study was to examine the effects of physical activity during hospital stay on falls, emergency room visits, and rehospitalizations among older patients with dementia at 1 and 6 months post discharge. This is a secondary data analysis. Bidirectional analysis using panel data from a cluster randomized clinical trial was utilized. The sample comprised 455 older adults with dementia from a clustered randomized clinical trial among 12 hospitals in 2 east coast states. The bidirectional relationships between physical activity at 1 and 6 months and falls, emergency room visits, and rehospitalizations at 1 and 6 months post discharge and their relations with physical activity at discharge were assessed using cross-lagged panel models, accounting for the autoregression of physical activity and adverse events over time. Age, race, gender, cognitive status, admission location, comorbidity, and intervention groups were controlled in the modeling. Physical activity at hospitalization discharge showed autoregressive associations for the 3 time points. Patients with a higher level of physical activity at discharge had a lower chance of falling (β = −0.250, SE = 0.094, OR = 0.779, P =.008) and rehospitalizations (β = −0.228, SE = 0.092, OR = 0.796, P =.013) within 1 month post discharge. Falls, emergency room visits, or rehospitalizations at 1 month were not significantly associated with physical activity, or any adverse events at 6 months. The findings from this study highlighted the significance and value of engaging older adults, particularly those living with dementia, in physical activity when hospitalized, as this reduced the likelihood of adverse events such as falls and rehospitalization at least in the first month post discharge.

Tools for Diagnoses Associated With Hospitalization of Nursing Home Residents With Severe Functional Impairment and Terminal Illness.

Diagnoses Associated With Hospitalization of Nursing Home Residents With Severe Functional Impairment and Terminal Illness.
By:Ouslander, Joseph G.;Engstrom, Gabriella;Yang, Zhiyou;+3 moreIn:Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, Sep2025, volume 26, issue 9, page N.PAGCINAHL
Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits can be uncomfortable and burdensome for severely impaired and terminally ill nursing home (NH) residents. Very few studies have examined specific diagnoses associated with these events. This is a secondary analysis of a trial that implemented a 12-month quality improvement program to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations (PAH) and ED visits of NH residents. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) was used to define residents with severe impairment of cognitive and physical functioning and those with terminal illness. Medicare claims data were used to identify hospital diagnoses for all cause hospitalizations (ACH), PAH, ED visits without hospitalization, and potentially avoidable ED visits. Among 6011 severely impaired residents of the 264 NHs, 34% had one or more ACHs, of which one-third met the criteria for PAH, and 18% had at least one ED visit without hospitalization, of which 70% met the criteria for potentially avoidable. Among 5810 residents identified as terminally ill, 14% had at least one ACH, of which 31% were PAH, and 8% had at least one ED visit, of which 80% met the criteria for potentially avoidable. The most common diagnoses associated with PAH were pneumonia and other infections, shortness of breath/respiratory failure, and altered mental status. In the severely impaired group, problems with feeding tubes were the most common diagnoses associated with potentially avoidable ED visits, and in the terminally ill group, it was fall-related trauma. ACH and ED visits without hospitalization are common among severely impaired and terminally ill NH residents. About one in three ACH in both groups met the criteria for PAH, and 70%-80% of ED visits met the criteria for potentially avoidable. Understanding the specific diagnoses associated with these potentially avoidable events can help target educational and quality improvement efforts to reduce their frequency, risk of hospital acquired complications, morbidity, and costs.

Tools for The Association of Prehospital Care Level and Triage Accuracy with Trauma Outcomes: A Multi-Country, Multicenter Cohort Study.

The Association of Prehospital Care Level and Triage Accuracy with Trauma Outcomes: A Multi-Country, Multicenter Cohort Study.
By:Nogueira, Lilia de Souza;Domingues, Cristiane de Alencar;Fernandes, Lillian Caroline;+8 moreIn:Journal of Trauma Nursing, Sep/Oct2025, volume 32, issue 5, pages 252-259 (8p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Proper triage and transport to trauma centers improve outcomes for severe trauma patients. However, little is known regarding these processes across Latin American healthcare systems, limiting regional improvement efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the association of prehospital care level and triage accuracy with hospital outcomes in trauma patients in Latin America. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in 14 hospitals across Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. Inclusion criteria were adult trauma patients aged ≥18 years admitted directly from the scene of injury. Data collection occurred over 30 consecutive days at each hospital between 2019 and 2021. Predictor variables included the level of prehospital care (none, basic, or intermediate/advanced) and triage accuracy (correct, undertriage, or overtriage). The primary outcomes were hospital length of stay and mortality. Associations were analyzed using linear regression for hospital stay and logistic regression for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,193 trauma patients were included (62.4% male, mean age 43.5 years. Motor vehicle crashes (43.3%) and falls (36.1%) were the leading causes of injury. Emergency medical services assisted 58.7% of patients, mainly at a basic level (n = 530). Overtriage occurred in 50.0%. Intermediate/advanced prehospital care was associated with longer hospital stays (β3.64, 95% CI [1.39, 5.89], p =.002). Neither prehospital care level nor triage accuracy was associated with hospital mortality (p ≥.050). CONCLUSIONS: In our study of 14 hospitals across Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, intermediate/advanced prehospital care was associated with longer hospital stays. Neither prehospital care level nor triage categorization was associated with hospital mortality.

By:Peng, Corey;Thomas, Josie;Samhouri, Mahasen;+2 moreIn:Laboratory Medicine, Sep2025, volume 56, issue 5, pages 500-503 (4p)CINAHL
Introduction The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments require nonconforming safety event identification, targeted intervention, and evaluation of interventional effectiveness. Without a standardized reporting structure, risk and safety teams will experience ongoing challenges with situational awareness and mitigation strategies in the workplace. Methods A 15-minute risk and safety huddle was initiated. The cadence was set to daily for the first iteration of huddle integration. A subsequent cadence was set to twice weekly, with a Microsoft Teams channel for streamlined communication across all laboratory settings. Results Huddling resulted in an averaged time savings of 14 days (approximately 2 weeks), measured from event to safety report. An observed reduction of 17.6% in employee-reported occupational safety events was noted between quarters 1 and 2 of 2023 and between quarters 1 and 2 of 2024, with a reduction in overall event spending ($458.50 [19.2%]) noted in 4 of the 5 measured safety event categories. An annual reduction in spending ($9568.09 [49.8%]) across all 5 measured safety event categories was noted in the 2022 (preinterventional) and 2023 (postinterventional) time frame. Discussion Laboratories should consider the establishment of a dedicated safety committee and cadenced huddles because such tools are effective for improving safety and communicating occupational hazards.

Tools for Costs Attributable to Falls Based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) Analysis of Hospitalised Patients: A Case–Control Study.

Costs Attributable to Falls Based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) Analysis of Hospitalised Patients: A Case–Control Study.
By:Fernández-Castro, Mercedes;Rivas-González, Noel;Martín-Gil, Belén;+4 moreIn:Nursing Reports, Sep2025, volume 15, issue 9, page 323CINAHL
Background/objectives: Falls are the most common adverse events in hospitals. This study aimed to estimate excess hospitalisation costs attributable to inpatient falls, using Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) relative weights as a proxy for resource consumption. Methods: Case–control study. Cases included patients who had sustained a fall during hospitalisation between 2020 and 2022 in 19 inpatient units. Controls were selected with matching technique based on age and admission period. Diagnosis-Related Groups and their resource consumption and cost estimators (relative weights) were provided by the Hospital's Coding Unit. Results: A total of 613 falls were analysed against 623 controls. The Diagnosis-Related Group 'Lower limb amputation except toes' was associated with a fourfold higher risk of falling compared to others. Five more were identified in which the case group incurred significantly higher costs than the control group. These included three surgical Diagnosis-Related Group, 'Urethral and transurethral procedures', 'Heart valve procedures without acute myocardial infarction or complex diagnosis', and 'Arterial procedures on the lower limb', and two medical, 'Heart failure' and 'Major pulmonary infections and inflammations'. Conclusions/Implications for practice: Identifying Diagnosis-Related Groups in which falls are associated with increased hospitalisation costs allows for a comprehensive assessment of the process, taking into account resource consumption and the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients. These findings will enable nurses to develop targeted strategies to enhance the safety of hospitalised patients that contribute to the sustainability of the healthcare system.

Tools for The Effect of Fear of Falling and Kinesiophobia on Older Patients' Readiness for Discharge After Total Joint Arthroplasty.

The Effect of Fear of Falling and Kinesiophobia on Older Patients' Readiness for Discharge After Total Joint Arthroplasty.
By:Dalkılıç, Mehmet;Savcı, Ayşegül;Turhan Damar, HaleIn:Orthopaedic Nursing, Sep/Oct2025, volume 44, issue 5, pages 286-295 (10p)CINAHL
This study was conducted to determine the relationship between older patients' readiness for discharge after total arthroplasty and fear of falling, kinesiophobia, and other variables. This correlational and cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 older people who had undergone total knee and hip arthroplasty. Data were collected using a Patient Descriptive and Clinical Information Form, the Fear of Falling Scale, the Visual Analog Scale, the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, and the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale-Short Form. The mean Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS) score was 4.70 ± 1.23, and 84.4% of the participants were found to be not ready for discharge. This is low in comparison to the findings from other studies. The model created for readiness for discharge explained 30% of the total variance (p < .005). The independent variables included in the model, namely fear of falling, pain, age, and number of mobilizations, were determined to be statistically significant predictors of readiness for discharge. It is necessary to support mobilization and manage the fear of falling and pain to increase older patients' readiness for discharge following surgery.

Introduction: In 2024, the GeMTeX project launched the largest ever de-identification campaign for German-language clinical reports, and, as a pilot study, published GraSCCoPHI, the first de-identified German-language gold standard corpus of synthetic discharge summaries. Methods: GeMTeX’s de-identification workflow is described here – including annotation tool management and, preannotation experience, such as assembling and training annotation groups and the evolution of guidelines. Results: We present the project's progress in the first year with respect to de-identification efforts and the challenges we faced during the rollout at six hospital sites in four German states. The refinement of the annotation guidelines became an ongoing process, often with unforeseen hurdles to overcome as we moved from testing to production. From our current internal interim corpus (9,000 documents with about 20 million tokens), we are publishing the first quantitative insights, such as the average amount of identifiable information per document, a list of confounding factors we did not anticipate at the beginning of the project, and three key lessons learned. Conclusion: We note that the unforeseen hurdles behave like the Pareto principle and fall into the set of less than 20% of the annotations.

Tools for Predictive validity of obstacle-crossing test variations in identifying fallers after inpatient rehabilitation for stroke.

Predictive validity of obstacle-crossing test variations in identifying fallers after inpatient rehabilitation for stroke.
By:Plummer, Prudence;Schliep, Megan E.;Jallad, Lina;+3 moreIn:Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, Sep2025, volume 32, issue 6, pages 631-639 (9p)CINAHL
Background: The ability to step over an obstacle is often evaluated as part of fall-risk and balance assessments. Although different obstacle-crossing tests exist, their comparative predictive validity in stroke is unknown. Objectives: To examine the predictive validity of different obstacle depths and different obstacle-crossing tests, including a novel, custom-height test and an existing "one-size-fits-all" obstacle test, for predicting post-stroke fallers. Methods: 46 independently ambulatory adults with stroke completed a custom-height obstacle-crossing test with 3 depths (0.5-inch, 1.5-inch, 3.0-inch) and the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) 1–3 days before hospital discharge. Falls were tracked prospectively for 3 months using fall calendars and fortnightly phone calls. Results: 35% of participants fell at least once in 3 months. Test accuracy was not significantly different between obstacle depth conditions. However, the 0.5-inch obstacle depth condition demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, and participants who failed were 9 times more likely to fall in the first 3 months after discharge than those who passed (95% CI 1.9, 42.1; p = 0.005). Performance on the obstacle item of the FGA at hospital discharge was not significantly associated with fall status at 3 months post-discharge and had a 50% floor effect. Conclusions: The ability to step over a custom-height obstacle may be a good indicator of post-stroke fall status 3 months after hospital discharge. Subtle increases in obstacle depth did not significantly alter accuracy. The "one-size-fits-all" obstacle test from the FGA had poor predictive validity at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation for stroke.

Clinical features and prognostic predictors for patients admitted to trauma intensive care unit due to fall from height in South Xinjiang.
By:Chen, Yong;Li, Wenwen;Wang, Xiaohong;+5 moreIn:International Journal of Emergency Medicine, 05/08/2025, volume 18, issue 1, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Background: Falls from height (FFH) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for a large proportion of trauma admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). Purpose: This study aims to summarize the clinical features and identify prognostic predictors associated with patients admitted to the trauma ICU due to FFH in south Xinjiang. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from April 2020 to July 2024 and included patients admitted to the trauma ICU due to FFH. Clinical data were extracted and analyzed. Injury locations were classified into the head, spine, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities. Clinical outcomes included length of stay in the ICU, ventilator use, and in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Patients were followed up after discharge to record 30-day mortality. Independent predictors of mortality were calculated using a logistic regression model. Results: A total of 289 patients (mean age, 40.3 years ± 17.9; 225 males and 64 females) were enrolled in the study. The median height of the fall was 3 meters, with 26.6% (77/289) falling from ≥5 meters and 11.4% (33/289) falling from ≥10 meters. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 24, with 63.3% (183/289) having an ISS greater than 20 and 41.5% (120/289) having an ISS greater than 25. Injuries involved ≥3 locations in 47.1% (136/289) of patients, ≥4 locations in 18.3% (53/289), and ≥5 locations in 7.6% (22/289). Mechanical ventilation was required for 36% (103/289) of patients, with an average ventilator duration of 103.5 (24–234) hours. The median length of ICU stay was 8 days (range: 1–132 days), and the overall in-hospital or 30-day mortality rate was 5.5% (16/289). The independent predictor of mortality was ISS (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.003–1.14; P =.04). Conclusions: The Injury Severity Score is a predictor of in-hospital or 30-day mortality due to falls from height.

Evaluation value of contrast enhanced ultrasound quantitative parameters in ischemic-type biliary lesions after liver transplantation—a prospectively study.
By:Feng, Ying;Li, Li;Wen, Wanwan;+6 moreIn:Abdominal Radiology, Aug2025, volume 50, issue 8, pages 3497-3505 (9p)CINAHL
Purpose: To explore the evaluation value of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) quantitative parameters in ischemic-type biliary lesions after liver transplantation to assist its early-diagnosis. Methods: Patients who underwent liver transplantation and intravenous CEUS at Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University from June 25, 2020 to December 28, 2022 and were diagnosed with Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBLs) by Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC) were prospectively enrolled. SonoLiver software was used to quantitatively analyze the contrast images, transplanted livers with normal biliary tracts as the control group. SPSS 25.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: There was a total of 35 patients enrolled in the study, and 15 ITBLs and 30 normal biliary tract of transplanted livers, respectively. The dynamic vascular patterns (DVP) curve of the ITBLs group was negative wave, while the DVP curve of the normal biliary tract group was positive wave. Compared with the patients with normal biliary tract, the Maximum intensity (IMAX), Rise slope 50% (Rs50), Area under curve (AUC), Area under curve in Wash-in phase (WinAUC), Wash in Rate (WinR), Rise slope 10-90% (Rs1090), and Wash out Rate (WouR) of the ITBLs group were lower, while the Fall slope (Fs50) was higher. There was no significant difference in Rise time (RT), Time to Peak (TTP), Fall half time (FHT), Mean transit time (mTT), Fall time (FT), WioAUC ((WioAUC = WinAUC + WouAUC)), and Area under curve in Wash-out phase (WouAUC) between the two groups (P > 0.05). The ROC curve results showed that Fs50 > -2.64 was the cutoff value for predicting ITBLs, with an area under the curve of 0.816 (95%CI: 0.683–0.949), and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.846 and 0.607; Rs50 < 7.08, AUC < 39761.7050, WinR < 101.7 and WouR < 474.52 were the cutoff values ​​for predicting ITBLs, with areas under the curve of 0.853 (95%CI: 0.728–0.979), 0.911 (95%CI: 0.783-1.000), 0.756 (95%CI: 0.615–0.896) and 0.700 (95%CI: 0.536–0.864). Conclusion: The quantitative parameters of CEUS imaging, such as IMAX, Rs50, AUC, WinAUC, WinR, Rs1090, WouR, and Fs50, are helpful in predicting ITBLs and improving the reproducibility of diagnosis. The threshold of these quantitative parameters will aid in the early diagnosis of ischemic-type biliary lesions after liver transplantation.

Tools for Ambulance responses to older adults who have fallen: a systematic review.

Ambulance responses to older adults who have fallen: a systematic review.
By:Gunson, Imogen M;Barley, Chloé;Rosser, Andy;+4 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Aug2025, volume 54, issue 8, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background Approximately 10% of emergency ambulance calls are for adults, 65 years and older, who have fallen. Structured management of this group could improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This review sought to synthesise evidence for ambulance-based care of older adults who had fallen and the associated impact on patient outcomes. Methods Eligibility. Peer-reviewed primary evidence, assessing older adults (aged ≥ 65) who had fallen and received an ambulance response. Information sources. CINAHL (EBSCO), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), HMIC (Ovid), Web of Science and AMBER were searched on 20 February 2025 with no date limit. Quality appraisal. Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tools. Synthesis. PRISMA reporting, with narrative synthesis using Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. Results Three thousand and forty-nine unique studies were identified. Nine studies were included, ranging from low- to high-quality randomised cluster trials and mixed-methods, prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Patients whose care included fall-specific decision-making tools or referral pathways, were less likely to be conveyed to hospital and more likely to access alternative community healthcare. However, poor uptake of participating paramedics limits the impact on practice. Few fall response or referral schemes were reported in the literature; those that exist have improved outcomes for patients. Where national practice guidelines exist, these were generally adhered to. Patient social characteristics, such as living alone, were the main reason for guideline deviation. Discussion Where fall pathways were implemented, outcomes improved, though implementation is contextual. Ambulance staff adhere to guidelines, but whether the guidelines reflect current presentations and treatment opportunities is unclear. Further research is required to establish generalisable approaches.

Tools for Hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions and adverse drug events in older adults: a systematic review.

Hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions and adverse drug events in older adults: a systematic review.
By:Cosgrave, Nicole;Frydenlund, Juliane;Beirne, Francis;+4 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Aug2025, volume 54, issue 8, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and adverse drug events (ADEs) are consistently reported to cause up to 30% of hospital admissions in older adults, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality and an added health economic burden. This systematic review aimed to establish the frequency of ADRs and ADEs as a cause of hospitalisation in older adults. Methods Standard databases and citations were searched from 2015 to 2025. Studies specifically assessing ADR and ADE prevalence and risk factors in older adults were included. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024613426) and quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria with bias determined via ROBINS-E. Results Nine studies underwent full evaluation. The reported prevalence of ADRs ranged from 3.3% to 23.1% and ADEs ranged from 11.75% to 18% as causes of hospitalisation. The median age of those included, in the respective studies, was between 77 and 86 years. Falls (19.4%–20.9%), delirium (7.3%–12.9%) and bleeding (8%–30.2%) were the most frequently encountered ADR/ADEs causing hospitalisation. Anti-thrombotics (11.5%–30.2%) diuretics (14.7%–30.2%) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (7.5%–8.9%) accounted for the highest proportion of ADR/ADE causative agents. Conclusion This review has limitations stemming from the heterogeneity of the included studies and the exclusion of the grey literature. However, ADRs and ADEs remain a significant cause of hospital admissions in older patients. The possible preventability of these and their possible hospital admission avoidance highlights the critical need for further research into ADR/ADE risk prediction methods in addition to co-morbidity and medication optimisation for older adults.

Tools for The world falls guidelines: how is implementation progressing globally?

The world falls guidelines: how is implementation progressing globally?
By:Seppala, Lotta J;Lord, Stephen R;Masud, Tahir;+4 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Aug2025, volume 54, issue 8, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
The World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults (WFG), from 2022, represent a global initiative to address the rising incidence of falls and related injury. WFG provides evidence-based recommendations across various settings, including community, hospital, and care home environments. A recent report highlighted a large variation in the implementation progress of the WFG across Europe. However, to date, a comprehensive global overview of the WFG implementation status has not been undertaken. To address this gap, we reached out to experts who took part in WFG to inquire about the implementation status of WFG in their countries. The responses from experts from 18 countries (one from Africa, six from Asia, one from Europe, three from North America, one from Oceania and six from South America) revealed that efforts to implement the WFG are underway in many of them, with differing degrees of progress varying from advanced integration into guidelines/policies to no/minimal actions. While the global implementation status of WFG is encouraging, significant barriers remain, including limited resources, competing health priorities, and cultural differences in care models. Adapting the WFG to diverse healthcare systems and integrating falls prevention into national policies and health priorities is essential to enable effective implementation. Furthermore, strengthening global collaboration, sharing best practices, prioritisation of the most effective and feasible falls prevention components in low resource settings, and advocating for falls prevention as a public health priority will help accelerate progress across the world for the benefit of older patients at risk of falling.

Tools for Preventable adverse events and related outcomes among people with dementia in hospital settings: scoping review.

Preventable adverse events and related outcomes among people with dementia in hospital settings: scoping review.
By:Catalán, Lucía;Oliveira, DéborahIn:Aging & Mental Health, Aug2025, volume 29, issue 8, pages 1414-1425 (12p)CINAHL
Objectives: To explore the hospital-related adverse events endured by people with dementia and assess their association with negative outcomes related to hospital care. Method: A scoping review was undertaken in October 2023. Primary studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English, Spanish, or Portuguese were included. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched. Results: Of the 1976 retrieved studies, 16 were included. Adverse events were more frequent among people with dementia compared to people without dementia. In studies with non-surgical and surgical patients, the most frequently reported were falls, delirium, and infections, while in studies exclusively conducted with surgical patients, these were postoperative delirium, infections, and other complications. The link between adverse events and negative outcomes was explored in only three studies and indicated that those who experienced adverse events had longer hospital stays, higher risk of mortality, and higher readmission rates within 90 days. Conclusion: Although we were unable to establish a direct link between adverse events and hospital outcomes due to the exploratory nature of this review, the findings suggest that mitigating such events could help improve outcomes among hospitalized people with dementia. Hospital safety measures appear to be insufficient to protect this group.

Tools for Optimizing Nurses' Time: Reducing Assessment Frequency in General Care.

Optimizing Nurses' Time: Reducing Assessment Frequency in General Care.
By:Chambers, Stephanie P.;Slack, Stephanie M.;Carlson, Marny L.;+2 moreIn:AJN American Journal of Nursing, Aug2025, volume 125, issue 8, pages 50-54 (5p)CINAHL
Background: Nurses represent a limited resource in the hospital environment. For decades, inpatient nurses have conducted head-to-toe assessments in roughly the same manner. At Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the practice has been twice-daily head-to-toe assessments, without reviewing the benefit of this frequency (vis-à-vis once daily) for patients, staff, and the institution. Purpose: This quality improvement (QI) project in a general care setting explored whether decreasing comprehensive physical assessments from twice daily to once daily was associated with changes in patient safety or care quality. Staff satisfaction was also assessed. Methods: After a pilot project showed the feasibility of changing to once-daily assessments, a QI project was conducted to compare a once-daily frequency of head-to-toe assessments with a twice-daily frequency for all adult patients admitted to a general medical unit. The intervention period was between August 1 and October 31, 2023; one assessment was performed between 7 AM and 7 PM in all patients not receiving hospice care or requiring more frequent assessments because of specific disease processes. Comparison data were obtained from patients who were on the unit in the three months before the intervention, from May 1 through July 31, 2023. Outcomes were patient safety events, code blue events, and rapid response team calls; hospital length of stay; performance rates of other required assessments (as a counterbalance measure), including delirium, pressure injury, and fall risk; and compliance with the new assessment schedule. Results: At the conclusion of the intervention period, no significant increases in reported patient safety events, code blue events, rapid response team calls, or hospital length of stay were observed. There were no decreases in compliance with required assessments, except for pressure injury, which decreased enough during the first month of the intervention to result in a statistically significant difference between the pre- and postintervention periods; however, compliance returned to baseline by the conclusion of the project. Among nursing staff, compliance with the once-daily assessment practice was high (80%), and staff feedback was positive; 96% of respondents indicated they would like to see the practice continue. Conclusion: The results of this QI project suggest that head-to-toe assessment frequency in the adult general medical patient population could be reduced to once daily without adversely affecting patient outcomes or safety. Further research is warranted to examine whether these results can be extrapolated to other units and institutions. This quality improvement project examined whether decreasing comprehensive physical assessments from twice daily to once daily affected patient safety or care quality, and also assessed staff satisfaction with the practice change.

Tools for Prevalence and types of fall-risk-increasing drugs identified by STOPPFall in hospitalized older adults: A retrospective observational study.

Prevalence and types of fall-risk-increasing drugs identified by STOPPFall in hospitalized older adults: A retrospective observational study.
By:Jeevanji, Sanjana;Mean, Marie;Aubert, Carole E.;+2 moreIn:Applied Nursing Research, Aug2025, volume 84, page N.PAGCINAHL
Falls are a major public health concern, with fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) recognized as modifiable risk factors. The STOPPFALL— Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions in older adults with high fall risk was recently developed to provide a comprehensive list of FRIDs, but few studies have assessed FRID prevalence using this tool. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of FRIDs in a Swiss hospital, investigate changes in FRID prescription among patients identified by nurses at high risk of fall, and explore the association between FRID exposure and in-hospital falls. This retrospective study analyzed health records of hospitalized patients over a one-year period. FRID prevalence at admission and discharge was assessed using the STOPPFall. Patients at risk of fall were identified based on the STRATIFY score. In-hospital falls were identified through incident reports. Of 741 participants, 44% (n = 332) were identified at high risk of fall, of whom 75% (n = 250) were prescribed at least one FRID at admission. The most frequently prescribed FRID classes were benzodiazepines, diuretics, and opioids. A significant reduction in FRID prescriptions was observed during hospitalization (p < 0.001). When high fall risk was documented by nurses, patients were less likely to be discharged with a FRID (p = 0.032). No significant association was found between FRID exposure and in-hospital falls. Incorporating the STOPPFall into clinical practice could provide a structured framework to identify FRIDs, support the prioritization of patients for medication review, and improve medication safety in older adults. • Of 741 hospitalized older adults, 44 % were identified by nurses as high fall risk. • Among high-risk patients, 75 % were prescribed at least one FRID at admission. • Diuretics, benzodiazepines, and opioids were the most frequently prescribed FRID classes. • Nurse-documented fall risk was associated with lower FRID prescribing at discharge (p = 0.032). • Integrating STOPPFall into nursing education and practice may enhance medication safety in older adults.

Tools for Co‐designing approaches to enhance falls management after spinal cord injury in an Australian spinal injuries unit.

Co‐designing approaches to enhance falls management after spinal cord injury in an Australian spinal injuries unit.
By:Marshall, Kathryn;Liddle, Jacki;Gustafsson, Louise;+3 moreIn:Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Aug2025, volume 72, issue 4, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Introduction: Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk of falls because of changes in sensation and motor function. While research exists on the consumer and clinician perspective of falls and fall prevention, these groups have not been brought together to determine how to effectively address this issue. The study aimed to co‐design approaches to enhance falls management including prevention of falls and post fall management, after SCI in inpatient spinal rehabilitation. Methods: Using an experience‐based co‐design process, six consumers and eight clinicians, including occupational therapists, each participated in multiple focus groups and/or individual interviews. Data were collected over three cycles and were used to (1) share and explore the experience and perspectives of falls after SCI, (2) determine possible approaches to enhance services currently offered, and (3) develop and refine principles to enhance falls management. Data analysis followed an interpretive description approach with constant comparative analysis. Following each cycle, researchers engaged in discussion, generated themes, and tested ideas in the following cycle. Consumer and community involvement: This research was completed with people with lived experience of SCI. Co‐investigators with lived experience of SCI were involved in the planning and conduct of the study. Findings: It was agreed that falls management is required lifelong for persons with SCI, although the important role of inpatient preparation was highlighted. Different perspectives were shared with consensus met on key issues and actions to address falls in the inpatient setting. Practice principles produced included getting everyone on the same page, learning to move safely through experience‐based learning, understanding it is more than just falls, and the need for individualised practice. Conclusion: This work has combined experiences and perspectives from consumers and clinicians with approaches developed for future service improvement to enhance falls management for people with SCI in inpatient spinal rehabilitation PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY This work asked people with spinal cord injury and people working in the hospital about falls in hospital. It wanted to find ways to improve how people can plan for and deal with falls in hospital and when they leave hospital. A series of one‐on‐one and group interviews found out about problems with how hospitals help people with falls now and ways to make it better. We learnt that people with spinal cord injury and people working in the hospital both need to work together. Also, people with spinal cord injury want to practice tasks to prepare for and deal with falls. They want to learn about how to be assertive and want education to be made just for them. This study shows how hospitals can improve what they are doing about falls.

Tools for Telehealth versus in‐person delivery of an occupational therapy home visiting service: A cost analysis.

Telehealth versus in‐person delivery of an occupational therapy home visiting service: A cost analysis.
By:Savira, Feby;Robinson, Suzanne;Grant, Rebecca;+4 moreIn:Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Aug2025, volume 72, issue 4, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Introduction: It is important to understand the cost implications of occupational therapy home visiting services, delivered using different modalities, supporting patients after discharge from the hospital. This study aimed to compare the costs of an occupational therapy home visiting service delivered via telehealth compared to services delivered in person, including the costs associated with any resultant adverse events. Methods: Cost analysis was conducted using data from a retrospective cohort study of adult patients recently discharged from two hospitals who received an occupational therapy home visiting service, including environmental assessment, provision of equipment, and home modifications. Health‐care system costs were quantified and compared between telehealth and in‐person delivery over the period 2020–2022. Total costs, cost per person, and cost savings, as well as contributors to cost savings, are reported. Consumer and Community Involvement: This cost analysis study had no consumer or community involvement. Results: Cost data were reviewed for a total of 537 patients (telehealth, n = 271, including 56 'hybrid' patients; face‐to‐face, n = 266). In‐person group had a greater number of overall encounters compared to the telehealth group, particularly with more frequent use of emergency and inpatient care. Telehealth resulted in a 34% cost reduction compared to in‐person care, equivalent to $4 million in savings to the health‐care system or a saving of $1186 per telehealth encounter. Telehealth savings were derived from lower number of inpatient and emergency encounters, as well as reduced patient‐related travel expenses. For repeat emergency and inpatient encounters, the total cost was $601,909 (82%) less for fall events and $31,772 (33%) less for delirium events, whereas the cost was higher for pressure injury events ($430,161 vs. $29,313 in in‐person group). Conclusion: Telehealth occupational therapy home assessments yielded cost savings over traditional in‐person visits, attributed to fewer inpatient and emergency visits and lower travel costs. The cost‐saving effect was observed for fall and delirium events, but not for pressure injury events, suggesting it may not be appropriate for all conditions. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Occupational therapists help patients recover at home after hospital stays. They assess home safety and provide education and equipment like rails and shower chairs. Usually, they visit patients' homes, which can be costly and time‐consuming. This study explored if telehealth could be a cheaper alternative. Patients received occupational therapy between 2020 and 2022, after leaving hospital. The costs were collected from the hospital for service delivery, any health service use, and we looked at if these patients had any problems after discharge such as falls, pressure injuries, or delirium and the costs of these. Overall, telehealth was 34% cheaper, saving the health system around $4 million, or $1186 per visit. Most of the savings came from fewer hospital visits and less travel. But for pressure injuries, telehealth ended up costing more. This shows that telehealth may not be the best option for every situation. Telehealth can be helpful and cost less to deliver occupational therapy home visiting services; however, we need to make sure this is directed to the right patients.

Under-reporting of falls in hospitals: a multisite study in South Korea.
By:Cho, Insook;Kwon, Joon-myoung;Choe, Whasuk;+3 moreIn:BMJ Quality & Safety, Aug2025, volume 34, issue 8, pages 491-498 (8p)CINAHL
Background Inpatient falls are adverse events that often result in injury due to complex interactions between the hospital environment and patient risk factors and remain a significant problem in clinical settings. Objectives This study aimed to identify (1) practice variations and key issues ranging from hospital fall management protocols to incident detection, and (2) potential approaches to address these challenges. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Four general hospitals in South Korea. Methods Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using the Donabedian quality outcomes model. Data were collected retrospectively during 2015-2023 from four general hospitals on local practice protocols, patient admission and nursing data from electronic records, and incident self-reports. Content analysis of practice protocol and manual chart reviews for hospital falls incidents was conducted at each site. Quantitative analyses of nursing activities and analysis of patient falls prevention interventions were also conducted at each site. Results There were variations in fall definitions, risk-assessment tools and inclusion and exclusion criteria among the local fall management protocols. The original and modified versions of the heuristic tools performed poorly to moderately, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.54-0.74 and 0.59-0.80, respectively. Preventive intervention practices varied significantly among the sites, with risk-targeted and tailored interventions delivered to only 1.15%-49.5% of at-risk patients. Fall events were not recorded in self-reporting systems and nursing notes for 29.5%-90.6% and 4.4%-17.1% of patients, respectively. Conclusion Challenges in fall prevention included weaknesses in the design and implementation of local fall protocols and low-quality incident self-reporting systems. Systematic and sustainable solutions are needed to help reduce hospital fall rates and injuries.

Tools for Effect of vestibular rehabilitation treatment on functional recovery in ischemic stroke patients with vestibular symptoms.

Effect of vestibular rehabilitation treatment on functional recovery in ischemic stroke patients with vestibular symptoms.
By:LI, Ya-qing;YIN, Miao-miao;CHEN, Jun-ying;+3 moreIn:Chinese Journal of Contemporary Neurology & Neurosurgery, Aug2025, volume 25, issue 8, pages 725-731 (7p)CINAHL
Objective To explore the effect of vestibular rehabilitation treatment on subjective symptoms, walking function and dynamic balance function of ischemic stroke patients with vestibular symptoms. Methods A total of 27 patients with vestibular symptoms who underwent vestibular rehabilitation treatment in Tianjin Huanhu Hospital from January 2022 to December 2024 were included, and they underwent individualized vestibular rehabilitation treatment, including optokinetic training, gaze stabilization, head and posture stabilization training and walking training for 30 times. Before and after the treatment, a wearable sensor inertial measurement unit was used to perform a 7 Meter Walk Test (7MWT) to assess gait, recorded the gait parameters including stride length, gait speed, percentage of double support phase time, foot strike angle (FSA), toe off angle (TOA), and turning angle velocity. The Activities- Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) to assess subjective balance confidence in completing various tasks, the dizziness/vertigo Visual Analog Scores (VAS) to assess the degree of dizziness/vertigo, the Bucket Test to assess the angle of subjective visual vertical (SVV) deviation, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) to assess the degree of dizziness disability, Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) to assess objective balance function, and Timed Up-Go Test (TUGT) to assess dynamic balance and turning ability. Spearman rank correlation analysis to explore the correlation of gait parameter differences with subjective tests and dynamic balance function before and after vestibular rehabilitation treatment. Results After vestibular rehabilitation treatment, stride length (t = - 4.877, P = 0.000), gait speed (t = - 4.458, P = 0.000), bipedal FSA (left foot t = - 5.590, P = 0.000; right foot t = - 4.751, P = 0.000) and TOA (left foot t = - 3.855, P = 0.001; right foot t = - 3.648, P = 0.001), turning angle velocity (t = - 5.140, P = 0.000), ABC score (Z = - 3.861, P = 0.000) and DGI score (Z = - 4.381, P = 0.000) were higher, while percentage of double support phase time (t = - 3.940, P = 0.000), dizziness/vertigo VAS score (Z = - 2.952, P = 0.003), SVV (Z = - 3.499, P = 0.000), DHI score (Z = - 3.397, P = 0.001) and TUGT time (Z = - 3.327, P = 0.001) were lower than those of pre- treatment. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that increase in step length was associated with improvement in ABC (rs = 0.464, P = 0.015), SVV (rs = - 0.469, P = 0.014), DGI (rs = 0.685, P = 0.000) and TUGT (rs = - 0.569, P = 0.002). The increase in gait speed was associated with improvement in ABC (rs = 0.525, P = 0.005), SVV (rs = - 0.381, P = 0.049), DGI (rs = 0.734, P = 0.000) and TUGT (rs = - 0.523, P = 0.005). The decrease in percentage of double support phase time was significantly associated with improvement in ABC (rs = - 0.504, P = 0.007), SVV (rs = 0.405, P = 0.036), DGI (rs = - 0.702, P = 0.000) and TUGT (rs = 0.559, P = 0.002). Conclusions Vestibular rehabilitation treatment can significantly improve the subjective perception of dizziness/vertigo, improve walking ability, ability to perform daily activities, confidence in balance, and dynamic balance function, and reduce the risk of falls in ischemic stroke patients with vestibular symptoms. It provides a basis for the implementation of precise individualized vestibular rehabilitation treatment in ischemic stroke patients with vestibular symptoms.

Improving Alarm Management Practices: Wireless Bed Exit Alerts on Medical-Surgical Units.
By:Clodfelter, Amy D.In:CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing, Aug2025, volume 43, issue 8, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
This study reviewed the application of sociotechnical models and frameworks to reduce wireless calls without introducing risk and impacting patient care, supplementing the findings of the study conducted by Clodfelter (Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 2024;315:463–467). This study was conducted at an 815-bed Magnet-recognized facility with comprehensive trauma, children's, and stroke services. Two models, both by Sittig and Singh, were applied to evaluate interdependent and interrelated concepts of human and technical components in the sociotechnical work system of medical-surgical nursing units. Sittig and Singh's (2010) eight-dimensional sociotechnical model comprehensively represents the factors influencing the design, development, use, implementation, and evaluation of health information technology. Interventions were piloted on three medical-surgical units with like hardware and software wireless integrations. The quantitative analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of the interventions, showing significant reductions in nuisance alerts without introducing new risks. Furthermore, there were no unintended consequences identified following the implementation of the intervention. There are direct, qualitative benefits related to decreased nuisance alarms and clinician experience. Return on investment and the value proposition reflect both tangible and intangible costs. Workflow changes, policy revisions, and system data were used to demonstrate meaningful improvement without unintended consequences. Tailoring workflows by addressing sociotechnical factors can reduce nuisance alerts and improve usefulness of systems.

Tools for Mitigating Skin Failure in Critically Ill Patients at the End of Life: A Case Report.

Mitigating Skin Failure in Critically Ill Patients at the End of Life: A Case Report.
By:Kordasiewicz, Lynn;Fik, Katie;Petry, Christy;+1 moreIn:Critical Care Nurse, Aug2025, volume 45, issue 4, pages 38-42 (5p)CINAHL
Introduction: Limited research on preventing and managing skin failure events such as deep tissue injuries and Kennedy terminal ulcers is available. These skin failure events often appear among patients experiencing multiple organ failure with hypoperfusion to the skin despite evidence-based nursing interventions to enhance skin integrity. Clinical Findings: A 68-year-old White man presented at a trauma hospital after several recent falls at home. He immediately required hospitalization. Several medical complications, including a deep tissue pressure injury, evolved. The pressure injury remained clinically stable throughout his hospitalization. Diagnosis: The patient received a diagnosis of deep tissue pressure injury. Interventions: Aggressive medical management, implementation of a turning schedule on a low-air-loss surface, foam dressings, and offloading boots were used to prevent skin damage and preserve skin integrity. Outcomes: The patient's condition declined and he developed a deep tissue pressure injury on the sacrum that did not advance or become infected. The family agreed to comfort measures and he soon died. Conclusion: Skin failure events such as deep tissue pressure injuries and Kennedy terminal ulcers often occur among critically ill patients, older patients, those approaching end of life, and other patients with prolonged pressure upon body surfaces. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services holds hospitals financially accountable for sequelae of events associated with hospital-acquired full-thickness pressure injuries. Additional research to categorize skin failure events as secondary to hypoperfusion and not medical mismanagement can optimize patient safety and positively impact the finances and credibility of medical organizations.

Tools for The impact of adapted hiking on quality of life and self-efficacy in wheelchair users: pre-post study.

The impact of adapted hiking on quality of life and self-efficacy in wheelchair users: pre-post study.
By:Passi, Martina;Annecchini, Alessia;Simeon, Rachele;+4 moreIn:Disability & Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, Aug2025, volume 20, issue 6, pages 1822-1828 (7p)CINAHL
Introduction: While leisure activities have been shown to have bio-psycho-social benefits for individuals with disabilities, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the quantitative analysis of the effects of adapted hiking. This study, therefore, aims to fill this void by using standardised tools to evaluate the enhancement in quality of life and self-efficacy following a hiking experience in individuals with motor disabilities. Methods: The intervention took place on natural paths by transporting Joëlette people who use wheelchairs for daily mobility. The rating scales were administered before the activity (T0) and three weeks after participation (T1). The outcomes were measured through the Wheelchair use Confidence Scale for manual wheelchair users (WheelCon-M), the Spinal Cord Injury-Falls Concern Scale (SCI-FCS), the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors (CHIEF), the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA), the Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised (CIQ-R) and the Moorong Self Efficacy Scale (MSES). Results: 34 people were recruited and participated in the study. The participants had an average age of 41 years; 28 used manual wheelchairs, and 6 used electric wheelchairs in their daily lives. From the analysis of the Wilcoxon rank test, the scores of the WheelCon-M were found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: This study significantly contributes to the scientific literature by providing quantitative data on the impact of adapted activities, particularly adapted hiking. The findings position adapted hiking as a valid intervention to support traditional rehabilitation treatments, specifically in enhancing confidence in wheelchair management. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: While leisure activities have been shown to have bio-psycho-social benefits for individuals with disabilities, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the quantitative analysis of the effects of adapted hiking. To conduct RCTs in Rehabilitation field can led to some issues, in order to overcome problems linked to Heterogeneity of Patients and standardisation of Interventions and thus create specific evidence of highly individualised and generalisable treatments, the most appropriate choice is certainly the use of clinical trials and case series. This clinical trial aimed to fill this void by using standardised tools to evaluate the enhancement in quality of life and self-efficacy following a hiking experience in individuals with motor disabilities. This study has enriched the scientific literature with quantitative data regarding the clinical role that adapted activities play on quality of life through the administration of validated scales to participants. It has contributed to validating the data present so far on adapted hiking, an activity that is showing more expressions of interest on the Italian territory of public authority and voluntary associations that promote well-being for people in different clinical conditions. The experience of participating in an adapted hiking activity has demonstrated a significant increase in the participants' sense of self-efficacy. This enhanced self-efficacy in managing the wheelchair in various environmental and social contexts of daily life not only improves their quality of life but also positions adapted hiking as a promising aid to conventional rehabilitation treatments.

Investigation of Balance, Kinesiophobia, and Mobility in Older Adults Exposed to Polypharmacy.
By:SALKIN, Yasemin;KAZAK SALTI, Aysun;ERDEN ERTÜRK, Sema;+1 moreIn:Duzce Medical Journal, Aug2025, volume 27, issue 2, pages 123-129 (7p)CINAHL
Aim: Older adults often face significant issues related to functionality, balance, and fall risk. This study aimed to investigate balance, kinesiophobia, and mobility in older adults exposed to polypharmacy. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study included a total of 75 individuals aged 65 years and over who were exposed to polypharmacy and presented to a university hospital between November 2023 and March 2024, and with a standardized mini-mental test (SMMT) score of 25 and above. Data were collected using the patient introduction and medication use questionnaire, the Berg balance scale (BBS), the Tampa kinesiophobia scale (TKS), and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Results: Individuals who completed the TUG test within 0-1414 seconds exhibited higher BBS scores when compared to those who completed the test in more than 14 seconds (p=0.001), while the TKS scores were lower (p=0.001). Furthermore, it was observed that individuals with a history of falls had higher TKS (p=0.001) and TUG test (p=0.001) scores than those without a history of falls. Additionally, the number of chronic diseases showed a negative correlation with BBS scores (rs=-0.319, p=0.005), while exhibiting a positive correlation with TKS scores (rs=0.263, p=0.023) and TUG test (rs=0.316, p=0.006) durations. Conclusion: The findings of the study indicate that polypharmacy has a deleterious effect on balance and mobility in older adults. It is imperative to evaluate the suitability of the prescribed medications and to take into account the patient's current medications prior to the initiation of new medications.

By:Elsorady, Khalid Elsayed;Abotaha, Ahmed Ahmed Mohamed;Shaheen, Mohammed Abdelmoaty Ebrahim;+3 moreIn:Electronic Journal of General Medicine, Aug2025, volume 22, issue 4, pages 1-6 (6p)CINAHL
Purpose: The study aimed to determine the predictors of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and its association with in-hospital mortality among critically ill geriatric patients Materials and methods: Prospective cohort study included 113 critically ill older patients at a geriatrics hospital in Egypt. Clinical history, laboratory analyses, Charlson comorbidity index, and simplified acute physiology score II were conducted on admission. Immuno-nutritional biomarkers included PNI, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The hospital outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: Median PNI was 33.45. Predictors of PNI were albumin and hematocrit. PNI showed a negative correlation with NLR (r = -0.475, p < 0.001), PLR (r = -0.263, p = 0.005), and SII (r = -0.287, p = 0.002). PNI < 35.475 and NLR > 6.5 defined in-hospital mortality with an area under the curve of 0.633, p = 0.011 and p = 0.612, p = 0.036, respectively. Conclusion: PNI < 35.475 and NLR > 6.5 are associated with in-hospital mortality. PNI had an inverse correlation with NLR, SII, and PLR.

Tools for Prevalence and accuracy of nursing diagnoses in patients with malignant bronchial and lung cancer: A retrospective observational study.

Prevalence and accuracy of nursing diagnoses in patients with malignant bronchial and lung cancer: A retrospective observational study.
By:Cesare, Manuele;Magliozzi, Erasmo;D'Agostino, Fabio;+2 moreIn:European Journal of Oncology Nursing, Aug2025, volume 77, page N.PAGCINAHL
To describe the prevalence and accuracy of nursing diagnoses (NDs) in adult patients with malignant bronchial and lung cancer. A retrospective, observational, monocentric study was conducted at the largest university hospital in Rome, Italy. Electronic health records (EHRs) of adult inpatients (≥18 years) hospitalized in 2022 with malignant bronchial and lung cancer were analyzed. NDs were documented using the Professional Assessment Instrument (PAI), a clinical nursing information system based on the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) standardized nursing terminology. The accuracy of nursing documentation was assessed with the D-Catch instrument, evaluating record structure, admission data, ND formulation, interventions, progress/outcome evaluations, and legibility. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze ND prevalence and documentation accuracy. A total of 682 EHRs were examined, identifying 3510 NDs across 34 distinct labels. Patients had a mean of 5.15 NDs (SD: 2.99; range: 1–16). Ten high-frequency NDs were identified, with Infection Risk (76.7 %), Fall Risk (66.6 %), and Acute Pain (53.1 %) emerging as the most prevalent. Overall documentation accuracy was high across most dimensions; however, ND formulation showed comparatively lower accuracy (mean score: 6.38; SD: 0.98). Evaluating the prevalence and accuracy of nursing diagnoses enhances the understanding of the complex care needs of patients with malignant bronchial and lung cancer, a population marked by significant clinical vulnerability and multidimensional care requirements. Strengthening diagnostic reasoning—through structured documentation systems and continuous training—may improve care planning, facilitate interdisciplinary communication, and ultimately optimize patient outcomes. • First study combining prevalence and accuracy of nursing diagnoses in lung cancer. • A total of 682 electronic health records analyzed, identifying 3510 standardized nursing diagnoses. • Infection risk , Fall risk , and Acute pain were the prevalent nursing diagnoses. • D-Catch revealed high documentation accuracy, but lower accuracy in nursing diagnoses formulation. • Findings highlight the need to strengthen nursing diagnostic reasoning to improve documentation quality.

Tools for Perceptions of Frail Older Adults on Contributing Factors Causing the Onset of Crises Leading to Hospital Admissions: A Qualitative Study.

Perceptions of Frail Older Adults on Contributing Factors Causing the Onset of Crises Leading to Hospital Admissions: A Qualitative Study.
By:Hoitinga, Gercora;Macneil‐Vroomen, Janet;Kolk, Daisy;+3 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Aug2025, volume 81, issue 8, pages 4883-4895 (13p)CINAHL
Aim: To explore frail older people's perceptions of factors contributing to a health crisis, describe similarities and depict these in a chronological, aggregated patient journey map. Design: An exploratory‐descriptive qualitative study. Methods: Frail older patients visiting the emergency department of a metropolitan academic hospital in the Netherlands during the first 6 months of 2021 were recruited by purposive sampling. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted and analysed thematically. Patient journey mapping was used to identify, combine and depict chronological similarities in perceptions. Results: Fifteen interviews contained five themes: continuity of healthcare, self‐perception on frailty, self‐management, impact of support system within an urban environment and acute event before the emergency department visit. The patient journey map identified uncoordinated care by healthcare providers, deterioration from at least 6 months before the emergency department visit and a time demarcation at 4 weeks before the emergency department visit with an unexpected event leading to an acute health problem. Conclusion: While patients were aware of the health event leading to the acute hospitalisation, they were less aware of the impact of contributing cascading events in the months before. The journey map suggests that strategies can be applied to inform older adults, be more patient‐oriented and provide an anticipated plan towards advance care, healthy ageing and admission avoidance. Impact: Findings showed contributing factors to a health crisis were not interpreted accordingly, creating a cascade of problems, difficult to counter when someone is already frail. By generating knowledge, standardising frequent assessments of daily life and intervening at an earlier stage by making use of the patient journey map, the risk of a potential crisis and hospitalisation could be reduced or even avoided. Reporting Method: COREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research). Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public contribution.

Tools for Teach-back communication to decrease falls in inpatient rehabilitation settings: a mixed-methods study.

Teach-back communication to decrease falls in inpatient rehabilitation settings: a mixed-methods study.
By:Miles, Kim;Fotopoulos, Rennie;Hutchinson, Anastasia F.;+2 moreIn:Journal of the Australasian Rehabilitation Nurses' Association (JARNA), Aug2025, volume 27, issue 2, pages 23-32 (10p)CINAHL
Aims To evaluate the acceptability, uptake and impact of a teach-back communication intervention for inpatient falls reduction on the rehabilitation wards of a large private, not-for-profit Australian health service. Design Quasi-experimental mixed-methods design. Methods Intervention ward clinical staff received education on teach-back communication and were surveyed pre- and post-training. Post-intervention staff focus groups, patient interviews, and a retrospective audit of administrative falls data were conducted. Falls rates per 1000 bed days were analysed using process-control charts. The study adhered to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) statement. Results Before implementation, most staff expected teach-back to be effective and easy to use. These positive perceptions remained postimplementation, though staff reported increased workload and requested additional training. Documented use of teach-back in patient records was modest. Falls rates decreased but showed spikes coinciding with COVID outbreaks. Conclusion Healthcare staff perceived teach-back communication to be a useable strategy. Documentation rates were low but improved with training. Implications for patient care Teach-back communication for falls reduction can be implemented in inpatient rehabilitation settings with high levels of staff acceptability and measurable reductions to rates of patient falls on the wards. Teach-back positively impacted falls rates but did not mitigate spikes caused by disruptions to the ward environment. Robust implementation of teach-back communication strategies that are also nested within further multimodal strategies for falls reduction are required for consistency of falls reduction. Future research should explore implementational aspects of this technique to support consistent application of fall prevention for all inpatients.

Tools for Beyond Radiation Exposure: Investigating the Complex Dimensions of Safety in the Catheter Laboratory.

Beyond Radiation Exposure: Investigating the Complex Dimensions of Safety in the Catheter Laboratory.
By:Uğrak, UğurIn:Lokman Hekim Health Sciences, Aug2025, volume 5, issue 2, pages 151-159 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: Catheterization laboratories are high-risk clinical environments where complex procedures are performed under time pressure and with radiation exposure. Qualitative research addressing the lived experiences of healthcare professionals in cath labs remains limited. This study aims to explore in depth the perceptions and experiences of healthcare professionals working in cath labs regarding patient and staff safety. Methods: This study used a qualitative research design based on interpretative phenomenological analysis. A total of 24 healthcare professionals from various occupational groups working in cath labs across Türkiye were included in the study through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed inductively using a thematic content analysis. Data analysis was performed using NVivo 10 software. Results: Two main themes emerged from this study: Risks and Measures. The most frequently reported risk was radiation exposure, followed by infection, pharmaceutical hazards, patient falls, excessive workload, and untrained personnel. Regarding safety measures, participants emphasized the importance of using radiation protective equipment, maintaining accurate medical records, adhering to aseptic practices, implementing fall prevention strategies, ensuring adequate staffing levels, verifying patient identities, and maintaining patient confidentiality and privacy. Discussion and Conclusion: This study revealed that safety practices in cath labs are predominantly shaped around radiation hazards, while a more holistic safety perspective tends to be overlooked. The lack of standardized protocols and heavy reliance on individual initiative were particularly noteworthy. The findings suggest that comprehensive and systematic strategies addressing all dimensions of risk are necessary to establish a sustainable safety culture in cath labs.

How Forward-Thinking Leaders Advance Patient Safety: The Health Equity Influencer Program at an Acute Care Setting.
By:Apollon-Ferron, Kathleen;Varghese, Lovelyamma;Louisma, Sindy;+3 moreIn:Nurse Leader, Aug2025, volume 23, issue 4, page N.PAGCINAHL
This manuscript explores a novel collaboration between nursing students and clinical partners through the Health Equity Influencers Program. Recognizing the gap in literature addressing implicit bias and patient safety, the school of nursing partnered with an urban acute-care hospital to develop a sustainable quality improvement (QI) initiative. The pilot examined the impact of implicit bias training on fall prevention and participants' ability to interrupt bias. Results demonstrated reduced fall rates and increased participants' confidence in addressing bias. Findings underscore Health Equity Influencers Programs role in bridging the gap between implicit bias recognition and actionable strategies to advance health equity and safety outcomes.

Tools for Exploring the concept of a 'long lie' after a fall to inform clinical pathways in pre-hospital services: a systematic literature review.

Exploring the concept of a 'long lie' after a fall to inform clinical pathways in pre-hospital services: a systematic literature review.
By:Holland, Joanne;Watkins-Webb, RachelIn:Nursing Older People, Aug2025, volume 37, issue 4, pages 20-26 (7p)CINAHL
Why you should read this article: • To understand the risks for older people of experiencing a 'long lie' after a fall • To enhance your knowledge of the physical and psychological effects for older people of experiencing a long lie • To reflect on whether conveying patients to hospital is always the appropriate course of action following a fall. The term 'long lie' is often used clinically to describe a situation where an individual has had a fall and has remained on the floor. However, there is no universal definition of what constitutes a long lie or recognition of the effect it can have on physical or psychological well-being. In August 2024, the authors undertook a comprehensive literature review on the subject. A search of articles published in English from the past 45 years which refer to adults over the age of 18 years who had a fall and a long lie, identified six articles. The outcome of the review demonstrates that there is a lack of primary literature that clearly defines a long lie. Nevertheless, ambulance and community first responders are encouraged to convey to hospital patients who have been on the floor for one hour or more, directly contradicting national health agendas that promote the delivery of acute care closer to home.

Tools for Nurses' experiences of providing dementia care in acute hospital settings.

Nurses' experiences of providing dementia care in acute hospital settings.
By:Addis, Gulen;Evans, DonnaIn:Nursing Older People, Aug2025, volume 37, issue 4, pages 27-33 (7p)CINAHL
Why you should read this article: • To enhance your understanding of the challenges of dementia care in acute hospital settings • To read about nurses' experiences of caring for patients with dementia on acute medical wards • To consider what is needed to overcome the challenges of providing optimal dementia care in hospital. Background: Increasing numbers of older people admitted to acute hospitals have dementia. For nurses, providing dementia care in acute settings involves unique challenges such as ensuring staff and patient safety and managing the stress caused by insufficient resources. Aim: To explore nurses' experiences and challenges when caring for patients with dementia in an acute general hospital setting. Method: This study used a qualitative approach and semi-structured interviews to explore participants' experiences of caring for patients with dementia. All permanent nurses working in three acute medical wards in one NHS trust (n=120) received an email inviting them to take part. Eight nurses volunteered to be interviewed. Findings: Three main themes were extrapolated from the thematic analysis of interview data: attributes of dementia care; planning care effectively; and staff education and training needs. Participants emphasised the importance of person-centred care and the challenges involved in providing such care due to staff shortages, which could result in frustration, exhaustion and stress for both staff and patients. Conclusion: Nurses in acute care settings need additional education and training to improve their knowledge and skills in relation to dementia care. The involvement of families is important for the optimal care of patients with dementia on acute hospital wards.

Advance Care Planning im Akutkrankenhaus: Eine qualitative Analyse der Bedingungen und Voraussetzungen.
By:Markgraf, Miriam;Meyer, Gabriele;Kirchner, ÄnneIn:Pflege, Aug2025, volume 38, issue 4, pages 183-194 (12p)CINAHL
Abstract: Background: Advance Care Planning (ACP) is an internationally established concept aimed to facilitate anticipatory care planning in the event of future inability to consent. In Germany, ACP is currently not regularly offered to patients in acute care hospitals. Aim: We aimed to identify preconditions for implementation of ACP in acute care hospitals in Germany through review of the international literature and expert interviews. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in the databases MEDLINE and CINAHL for internationally used strategies for implementing ACP in acute care hospitals. Consecutively, a guide for interviews with experts to evaluate the strategies was developed. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Results: Out of 13 included publications, 17 preconditions were identified and assigned to 16 categories after evaluation by experts. In international ACP programs, it was described how to proceed and organize the ACP conversation. German experts emphasized that appropriate preconditions, such as sufficient time resources and training, must be granted, whereas the literature search revealed the conversation process and organization as important determinants. Conclusions: The implementation of ACP programs is conceivable, but requires specific conditions as legal regulation and defining and structuring of the processes.

Tools for Evaluating the Application of an EMS Clinical Judgment Theoretical Framework.

Evaluating the Application of an EMS Clinical Judgment Theoretical Framework.
By:McAllister, Nicole T.;McBride, Nadine L.;Salhi, Hussam E.;+6 moreIn:Prehospital Emergency Care, 2025, volume 29, issue 6, pages 738-743 (6p)CINAHL
Objectives: Clinical judgment (CJ) encompasses clinical reasoning (process of evaluating a problem) and clinical decision-making (choice made). A theoretical model to better define emergency medical services (EMS) CJ has been developed but its use has not been evaluated in EMS training and assessments. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of this EMS CJ model to assess clinical reasoning and decision-making in a simulated environment. Methods: In this evaluation, EMS clinician teams (2–3 members) were directed to care for a simulated older adult patient in their home following a fall. Simulations were video recorded, clinician team actions coded, and evaluated for whether proper CJ reasoning and decisions were made. We evaluated CJ in two ways: 1) EMS medical directors' (MD) determination of whether the CJ questions were addressed (MD score) and 2) objective rubric evaluation of CJ questions using the EMS CJ model focused on recognition of appropriate cues, performance of actions, and revaluation after action (rubric score). The CJ questions addressed in this simulation included: 1) Is the patient stable/unstable?, 2) Are interventions necessary before movement?, 3) How should the patient be transferred from the floor?, and 4) Does the cause of the fall require hospital evaluation? Descriptive statistics were calculated, and concordance between the two assessments was evaluated (mean, 95% CI). Percent concordance was calculated with a validity threshold set at 70%. Results: Four EMS MDs reviewed 20 videos addressing 80 clinical judgment decisions. Overall concordance between MD score and rubric score for CJ decisions was above the threshold at 88.1% (85.0, 91.2). Concordance between MD score and rubric score for each CJ decision was 92.0% (87.3, 96.7) for question 1, 79.9% (71.5, 88.3) for question 2, 95.0% (90.4, 99.6) for question 3, and 85.4% (79.5, 91.2) for question 4. Conclusion: An objective evaluation of CJ decisions using a rubric derived from an EMS CJ theoretical framework demonstrated high concordance to subjective evaluations of CJ made by EMS MDs. This approach may allow for reproducible and objective CJ evaluations that could be used for competency assessment in EMS.

Tools for Descriptive Analysis of Supervised Falls Occurring During Physical Therapy Sessions in Adult Inpatient Rehabilitation.

Descriptive Analysis of Supervised Falls Occurring During Physical Therapy Sessions in Adult Inpatient Rehabilitation.
By:Camillieri, Susan;Weiss, Cara;Zervas, Michael;+1 moreIn:PTJ: Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Journal, Aug2025, volume 105, issue 8, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Importance Falls are commonly reported incidents that affect the safety of patients during inpatient hospitalization. Inpatient rehabilitation (IR) units report the highest fall rates when compared with other hospital units. Falls commonly result in patient injury and elevate episode costs. There is a dearth of information regarding characteristics of patients who fall during physical therapy sessions, which represents a unique subset of falls. Objective The aim of the study was to describe the nature of falls, characteristics of fallers, and characteristics of therapists who experienced patient falls, which occurred during physical therapy sessions in IR. Design This was an observational study which included a retrospective analysis of medical records. Setting This study examined falls occurring within 2 IR departments at a large hospital system located in an urban setting in the United States. Participants This study involved patients receiving adult IR with diagnoses including, but not limited to, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Exposures This study examined characteristics of patients who fell as compared with patients who did not fall, quantified the conditions surrounding falls, and described physical therapists who experienced patient falls. Main Outcomes and Measures Mann–Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to compare characteristics of faller and non-faller groups. Results Among the 6238 unique patient admissions, a total of 40 falls were identified. The rate of falling was 0.43 falls per 1000 patient days. The majority of falls occurred because of buckling (47.5%) and during gait training (40.0%). Falls most often occurred close to discharge (mode = 6 days prior). Fallers were younger than nonfallers (exponential power of B, ie, Exp[B], = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.04). Diagnoses representing the largest proportion of fallers included brain dysfunction/stroke (30.0%) and spinal cord injury/peripheral nerve injury (30.0%). Fallers had comorbid diabetes mellitus type 2 (Exp[B] = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.45–5.04) and received renal dialysis (Exp[B] = 3.23; 95% CI = 1.14–9.17) in a higher proportion than nonfallers. Fallers were often high functioning, the majority receiving at most minimal assistance (72.5%). Falls most often occurred with therapists who had 1 to 2 years of experience (27.5% of falls). Conclusions The rate of falls during therapy was lower than the rate of falls previously reported in similar settings. Therapists should exercise caution when managing younger patients and patients with certain diagnoses. Therapists should screen for buckling risk when prescribing higher-risk activities. Therapists with various levels of experience should receive fall prevention training. Clinical Relevance Therapists can use frequently occurring patient characteristics to screen for falling and use additional precautionary measures, particularly for patients with specific diagnoses, at higher risk for knee buckling, and of a younger age.

Based on hospitals' electronic health records (EHRs), emergency medical responders work in high-stress and hazardous environments, making ergonomics an essential tool for assessing and reducing the risks associated with improper work postures to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). The objective is to evaluate the risk of work postures and recommend improvements to prevent future injuries. In this research, the REBA (rapid entire body assessment) and RULA (rapid upper limb assessment) methods were used to evaluate the ergonomic risks of common work postures of emergency medical services (EMS) personnel during their duties in scenarios such as lifting and moving the patient at the scene, performing medical procedures in the ambulance, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the ambulance. The results indicated that the ergonomic risks of work postures for emergency medical responders had an average REBA score ranging from 9.20 to 11.49, which falls within a high to very high-risk level. Meanwhile, the average RULA score for upper limb work ranged from 5.50 to 6.61, indicating a risk level that requires necessary changes soon. In summary, this assessment helps us identify potential risks associated with work that could impact the health and safety of medical personnel. It may also contribute to developing preventive measures and improvements in field operations.

With the aging of the overall patient population, the incidence of patients developing delirium during hospitalization is increasing. This study aims to improve post-operative safety management and reduce the workload of nurses related to patient care. We have developed a monitoring system that uses 3D sensors to detect specific behaviors and motions that require attention in cases where patients exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as falls and self-removal of IV lines, and trigger alerts. In this paper, we present an algorithm for detecting dangerous motions. We use the point cloud data generated by the 3D sensors that collect 3D information. We analyze the motions of subjects based on changes in the point cloud data and tag specific human body motions and behaviors. When there are no obstacles in the imaging direction of the 3D sensors, we detect human body movements (supine position on the bed, half sitting up, and separated from the bed) with an F-measure of 98.33% and motions (thrashing limbs, touching mouth/neck/arms, no action) with an F-measure of 98.23%. We detect the basic motions that trigger alert notifications. However, the detection accuracy decreases depending on the imaging conditions and subject movements. We use invisible and safe near-infrared light for motion detection and recognition to perform imaging even after lights are turned off, without disturbing patients' sleep. Motion recognition using point cloud data is a privacy-friendly monitoring method with a low risk of acquiring personally identifiable information. In the future, we plan to verify the algorithm using actual patients and investigate the detection of motions in addition to those considered in this study.

Falls cause significantly extend hospital stays, diminish patients' quality of life, and drive-up healthcare costs. The purpose of this study is to develop a clinical evaluation method to assess the risk of falling associated with different bed heights, thereby offering a new perspective on fall-prevention strategies in hospitalized patients. Data were collected in a single Japanese hospital from August to October 2024. Two bed types were compared: a standard bed at approximately 60 cm in height and a low bed at approximately 30 cm. Over the three-month period, 3,422 patients, accounting for 32,708 man-days, met the study criteria. Of these, 31,293 man-days used standard beds, while 1,415 man-days used low beds. A total of 72 falls occurred in the standard bed group and 4 in the low bed group, yielding fall rates of 0.23% and 0.28%, respectively. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test showed no significant difference between the two bed types (p = 0.57).

Tools for Epidemiology and injury characteristics of children with acute traumatic hand injuries undergoing surgery: a 10-year retrospective cohort study.

Epidemiology and injury characteristics of children with acute traumatic hand injuries undergoing surgery: a 10-year retrospective cohort study.
By:Savaş, Serpil;Altuntaş, Selman Hakkı;Uslusoy, Fuat;+1 moreIn:Turkish Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery / Ulusal Travma ve Acil Cerrahi Dergisi, Aug2025, volume 31, issue 8, pages 729-738 (10p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of acute hand injuries requiring surgery in children is not well understood in our country. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological and injury characteristics of surgically treated acute traumatic hand injuries in children, considering different age groups and injury severity, and to offer preventive recommendations. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive, epidemiological study of surgically treated acute traumatic hand injuries observed between 2004 and 2024 in a tertiary university hospital. The analysis included patients under 18 years old and examined demographics, injury mechanisms, causes, injury characteristics, and severity using the Modified Hand Injury Severity Scale (MHISS). RESULTS: A total of 295 patients were enrolled in the study. Injuries were most common among males and adolescents. The most frequent mechanism of acute hand injury was laceration (78.6%). Accidental falls with glass cups in toddlers and preschool children, street glass shards in schoolchildren, and punching glass in adolescents were the most common causes of lacerations. The Modified Hand Injury Severity Score (MHISS) indicated that most hand injuries were moderate (35.9%). Complex injuries accounted for 39.7% of all cases, and 10.8% of patients required additional surgeries. CONCLUSION: Most injuries happen in boys and usually involve lacerations that affect flexor tendons and major nerves, typically of moderate severity. Toddlers and preschool children should not be given glass cups, and schoolchildren should not be allowed to play outside designated playground areas, as there may be shards of glass in certain areas. Schools, families, and adolescents should be informed about the dangers of punching window glass. Raising parental awareness and educating the community can help reduce the occurrence of these injuries.

Tools for Mortality prediction in geriatric patients with multiple trauma presenting by ambulance.

Mortality prediction in geriatric patients with multiple trauma presenting by ambulance.
By:Yurtseven, Aynur;Kayıpmaz, Afşin EmreIn:Turkish Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery / Ulusal Travma ve Acil Cerrahi Dergisi, Aug2025, volume 31, issue 8, pages 739-746 (8p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: The Modified 5-Factor Frailty Index (mFI-5) has been shown to predict complications following treatment in geriatric patients. However, few studies have compared the mFI-5 with other trauma scoring systems in cases involving multiple injuries. This study aimed to evaluate the Relationship Between mFI-5, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score (GTOS) and their association with mortality in geriatric trauma patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 65 and older who were admitted to the emergency trauma unit of a tertiary care hospital. Data collected included laboratory parameters, imaging results, blood transfusion requirements, hospitalization status, intensive care unit admission, surgical intervention, ISS, GTOS, mFI-5 scores, and mortality outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were included, with a mean age of 78.12 (±8.34) years. Falls were the most common cause of trauma (n=142, 58.9%). Thoracic injuries were the most frequently observed (n=86, 53.7%). Patients who died within the first 24 hours of admission had significantly higher ISS (14.1 vs. 26.33), GTOS (119.02 vs. 157.33), and mFI-5 (2.53 vs. 3.33) scores (p=0.001, p=0.001, and p=0.017, respectively). Similar trends were noted for one-month and three-month mortality (p=0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: Scoring systems are essential for early mortality prediction in geriatric trauma patients. ISS, GTOS, and mFI-5 scores have shown similar effectiveness in predicting comorbidities, intensive care unit admission, and mortality in geriatric trauma patients. ISS involves a complex calculation, while GTOS, although specifically designed for geriatric patients, requires additional computations based on the ISS. In contrast, mFI-5 may be more practical in emergency settings because it is easy to calculate.

Calcaneus fractures are common orthopedic injuries, often caused by high-energy impacts such as falls from height or direct trauma. These fractures can result in severe pain, swelling, and dysfunction of the heel. Surgical intervention is essential to reduce the risk of post-traumatic arthritis and restore foot function. However, traditional open surgical approaches can lead to complications such as incision infections and skin necrosis due to the extensive soft tissue exposure required. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of distractor-assisted, arthroscopy-guided minimally invasive screw fixation for treating Sanders type II and III intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Conducted at Weifang People's Hospital from February 2022 to February 2024, the study involved 60 patients randomized into two groups: a minimally invasive group (n = 30) and an open reduction group (n = 30). The minimally invasive group received distractor-assisted, arthroscopy-guided reduction with percutaneous screw fixation, while the open group underwent open reduction with plate fixation. Primary outcomes included surgical time, incision length, operative duration, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and fracture healing time. Secondary outcomes involved calcaneal dimensions, functional scores (AOFAS, Maryland Foot Function Score, VAS for pain), and complications at one-year follow-up. At one-year follow-up, all fractures had healed, with an average healing time of 12 weeks. The minimally invasive group showed significant advantages in surgical parameters and pain relief, with no significant differences in functional outcomes. In conclusion, distractor-assisted, arthroscopy-guided minimally invasive screw fixation is an effective, minimally traumatic treatment option for Sanders type II and III calcaneal fractures.

Tools for Predicting mortality and intensive care needs in geriatric trauma patients: A ROC analysis of frailty and trauma scoring systems.

Predicting mortality and intensive care needs in geriatric trauma patients: A ROC analysis of frailty and trauma scoring systems.
By:Hamdioğlu, Enes;Altuntaş, Mehmet;Çelik, Ali;+1 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, 07/21/2025, volume 51, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: The global increase in the geriatric population presents significant challenges for healthcare systems. Trauma, mainly resulting from falls, constitutes a primary cause of morbidity and mortality among older people. It is imperative to evaluate mortality risk and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission among geriatric trauma patients to optimize clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess the efficacy of frailty and trauma scoring systems in predicting these critical outcomes. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Türkiye from September 2023 to October 2024. The study population consisted of geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) presenting blunt trauma. Comprehensive demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Mortality risk and ICU admission requirements were assessed utilizing various scoring systems: the Frailty Index (FI), Clinical Frailty Score (CFS), Trauma-Specific Frailty Index (TSFI), Shock Index (SI), Modified Shock Index (MSI), Age Shock Index (ASI), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score (GTOS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the predictive accuracy of these scores. Results: The cohort comprised 350 patients with a median age of 74 years. The mortality rate observed was 11%, with non-survivors had significantly higher frailty and trauma scores compared to survivors (p < 0.001). Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was necessary in 20% of the cases. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the GTOS and RTS exhibited the highest and identical Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, both recorded at 0.846. Furthermore, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for GTOS and RTS were 0.790–0.901 and 0.762–0.930, respectively, while the AUC for ICU admission requirements reached 0.830 (95% CI: 0.764–0.864) for RTS and 0.815 (95% CI: 0.755–0.876) for GTOS. Among the frailty scores, TSFI proved to be superior in predicting mortality, achieving an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI: 0.725–0.885), whereas the Frailty Index (FI) demonstrated the lowest predictive capacity for ICU needs, with an AUC of 0.666 (95% CI: 0.592–0.740). Conclusion: Frailty and trauma scoring systems serve as critical tools in predicting outcomes for geriatric trauma patients. The Revised Trauma Score and the Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score have demonstrated the highest reliability in forecasting both mortality and the need for ICU admissions. While the Trauma-Specific Frailty Index has exceeded other frailty indices in terms of mortality prediction, the Frailty Index exhibits limited utility for ICU evaluations. Integrating these scoring systems into clinical practice can significantly enhance the identification of high-risk patients and improve care strategies.

Tools for A Path to Better Care for Older Adults: Optimizing Medicare and Medicaid Payments Through Implementation of the CMS Age Friendly Hospital Measure.

A Path to Better Care for Older Adults: Optimizing Medicare and Medicaid Payments Through Implementation of the CMS Age Friendly Hospital Measure.
By:Pelton, Leslie J.;Mate, Kedar;Snyder, Rani E.;+1 moreIn:Inquiry (00469580), 07/16/2025, pages 1-4 (4p)CINAHL
Over 95% of US hospitals rely on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for at least 50% of their revenue, and almost all participate in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program. Starting January 1, 2025, hospitals in the IQR program will avoid Medicare payment reductions by reporting on the 5 domains of the CMS Age Friendly Hospital Measure. This is essential because the population of older adults is increasing, as are the harms older adults experience in US hospitals. Meeting these 5 domains is associated with providing higher-quality care for older adults, leading to improved outcomes and reduced costs. Reporting on the CMS Age Friendly Hospital Measure will be visible to older adults and their family caregivers through CMS Care Compare. There are evidence-based initiatives that hospitals can implement to achieve the CMS Age Friendly Hospital Measure and to prevent or reduce iatrogenic harm in older adults such as falls, adverse drug events, and delirium, reduce length of stay in emergency departments, improve outcomes and reduce length of stay, and reduce overall cost of care to Medicare.

Objective: To investigate the effect of skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra(L3-SMI) on fall risk in adult inpatients. Methods: A total of 429 patients admitted to a tertiary grade A hospital in Jinan city, Shandong province were selected from December 2022 to June 2024. General patient data of patients was investigated. While admission fall risk, L3-SMI, nutritional risk, self-care ability, and pain were assessed. Results: Among the 429 adult inpatients, 163(38.00%) were at moderate -to -high fall risk. Normal L3 -SMI was observed in 358 patients(83.45%), while low L3-SMI was found in 71 patients(16.55%). Results of multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, department, number of medications, nurse-to-patient ratio, nutritional risk, self-care ability, history of hypertension, and history of diabetes, L3-SMI was a significant influencing factor for moderate-to-high fall risk(P<0.05). Results of subgroup analysis showed that among patients aged>65 years, with BMI<24.0 kg/m², and with independent or mildly dependent self-care ability, those with low L3-SMI had a significantly higher fall risk(P<0.05). Conclusions: Adult inpatients with low L3-SMI were at moderate-to-high fall risk.L3-SMI may serve as a screening indicator to identify individuals at moderate-to-high fall risk. It also may provide a basis for fall risk management and clinical decision-making in adult inpatients.

Tools for Prognostic Value of Computed Tomography-Derived Muscle Density for Postoperative Complications in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) and Non-ERAS Patients.

Prognostic Value of Computed Tomography-Derived Muscle Density for Postoperative Complications in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) and Non-ERAS Patients.
By:Palmas, Fiorella X.;Ricart, Marta;Lluch, Amador;+8 moreIn:Nutrients, Jul2025, volume 18, issue 14, page 2264CINAHL
Background: Prehabilitation programs improve postoperative outcomes in vulnerable patients undergoing major surgery. However, current screening tools such as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) may lack the sensitivity needed to identify those who would benefit most. Muscle quality assessed by Computed Tomography (CT), specifically muscle radiodensity in Hounsfield Units (HUs), has emerged as a promising alternative for risk stratification. Objective: To evaluate the prognostic performance of CT-derived muscle radiodensity in predicting adverse postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer patients, and to compare it with the performance of the MUST score. Methods: This single-center cross-sectional study included 201 patients with non-metastatic colon cancer undergoing elective laparoscopic resection. Patients were stratified based on enrollment in a multimodal prehabilitation program, either within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol or a non-ERAS pathway. Nutritional status was assessed using MUST, SARC-F questionnaire (strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs, and falls), and the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. CT scans at the L3 level were analyzed using automated segmentation to extract muscle area and radiodensity. Postoperative complications and hospital stay were compared across nutritional screening tools and CT-derived metrics. Results: MUST shows limited sensitivity (<27%) for predicting complications and prolonged hospitalization. In contrast, CT-derived muscle radiodensity demonstrates higher discriminative power (AUC 0.62–0.69), especially using a 37 HU threshold. In the non-ERAS group, patients with HU ≤ 37 had significantly more complications (33% vs. 15%, p = 0.036), longer surgeries, and more severe events (Clavien–Dindo ≥ 3). Conclusions: Opportunistic CT-based assessment of muscle radiodensity outperforms traditional screening tools in identifying patients at risk of poor postoperative outcomes, and may enhance patient selection for prehabilitation strategies like the ERAS program.

Background: Qatar is one of six neighboring countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council region that form a political and economic alliance to foster multilateral cooperation. Given the shared challenges in trauma care, there is a need for a collaborative network to develop region-specific injury prevention strategies. For example, this study examines the clinical patterns and predictors of hospital mortality among trauma patients in Qatar. Methods: A retrospective analysis of trauma-related deaths (2010–2023) was conducted. Patients were stratified into early hospital mortality (EHM, ≤ 48 h) and late hospital mortality (LHM, > 48 h) groups. Further analyses examined in-hospital mortality (24 h, 24–48 h, 3–7 days, and > 7 days), age groups, injury mechanisms, and severity. A multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of early mortality. Results: Among 2,452 trauma-related deaths, 59% occurred in pre-hospital, while 41% occurred in-hospital. Compared to LHM (47%), EHM (53%) was associated with a younger age (35 vs. 39 years; p = 0.002), higher systolic blood pressure (0.82 vs. 0.67; p = 0.002), and diastolic blood pressure (2.03 vs. 1.75; p = 0.001). Motor vehicle crash (MVC) was the leading cause of death (35.3%), with vulnerable road users (VRU) the commonest in EHM (p = 0.004) and falls in LHM (p = 0.004). LHM was associated with a higher injury severity score (p = 0.001). On-admission systolic shock index independently predicted EHM (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.09–4.52), while head (OR 7.14; 95% CI 2.44–20.00) and pelvic injuries (OR 3.70; 95% CI 1.19–11.11) and sepsis (OR 6.25; 95% CI 1.22–33.33) predicted LHM. In-hospital deaths exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 24 h (15%) and between the third and seventh days (10%). EHM showed an upward trend over the years (R² = 0.312), while LHM remained stable. Trauma-related mortality rates declined from 10.4 to 5.0 per 100,000 population (2011 and 2017) before rising to 9.7 by 2022. Pre-hospital deaths followed a similar pattern to the overall mortality, while the in-hospital rates remained steady. VRU-related injuries persisted at a high level, accounting for 26–43% of cases throughout the study period. Conclusion: This study highlights distinct trauma-related mortality patterns, with EHM linked to hemorrhage and shock, while LHM is associated with severe head injuries and sepsis. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to optimize bleeding control and address predictors such as shock indices for EHM and head injuries for LHM.

Epidemiology, risk factor, and economic analysis of peripheral nerve injury following distal radius fractures.
By:Miskiewicz, Michael;Hakimi, Aaron;Ling, Kenny;+3 moreIn:European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology, 04/07/2025, volume 35, issue 1, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Purpose: Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are a common orthopaedic injury with a bimodal age and gender distribution, comprising male children after high-energy trauma and older women after low-energy falls. Complications like malunion, ligament ruptures, and nerve injuries can significantly impact recovery. This study aimed to address the gap in population-based data by analyzing the prevalence and risk factors for peripheral nerve injuries associated with DRFs. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample database was used to analyze DRFs patients with associated ulnar, median, or radial nerve injuries. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and fracture characteristics were analyzed using chi-square tests and binary logistic regression to determine independent risk factors. Finally, independent sample t-tests assessed differences in average lengths of stay and total hospitalization charges between patients with and without ulnar, median, or radial nerve injuries. Results: Between 2015 and 2020, 175,040 patients with DRFs were admitted to U.S. hospitals, with 0.24% experiencing ulnar nerve injury, 0.49% median nerve injury, and 0.08% radial nerve injury. Age, race, fracture morphology, and several comorbidities were identified as significant predictors of nerve injury. Open fractures notably increased the odds for all three nerve injuries. Protective factors included older age, intra-articular fractures, and comorbidities like diabetes and obesity. Peripheral nerve injuries were associated with longer hospital stays and increased total hospitalization costs. Conclusions: Peripheral nerve injuries related to DRFs are rare but can significantly complicate treatment and recovery. This study investigated the prevalence of nerve injuries associated with DRFs and identified open fractures as the strongest predictor of ulnar, median, and radial nerve injuries at the wrist. Older age and intra-articular fractures were linked to a reduced risk of nerve involvement. These findings can help orthopaedic surgeons assess the risk of concurrent nerve injuries by considering key demographic and fracture morphology factors, allowing for more targeted evaluation and management.

By:Li, Lu;Jiang, Lingxiao;Yang, Kun;+2 moreIn:Abdominal Radiology, Jul2025, volume 50, issue 7, pages 3092-3099 (8p)CINAHL
Objective: Despite cystoscopy plays an important role in bladder tumors diagnosis, it often falls short in flat cancerous tissue and minuscule satellite lesions. It can easily lead to a missed diagnosis by the urologist, which can lead to a swift tumor regrowth following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Therefore, we developed a deep learning-based intelligent diagnosis system for early bladder cancer to improve the identification rate of early bladder tumors. Methods: Video data from 273 bladder cancer patients who underwent TURBT at Zhongnan Hospital were collected. The dataset was carefully annotated by urologists to clearly define tumor boundaries. Subsequently, we developed a new bladder tumor segmentation network (BTS-Net) based on transformer to accurately diagnose early-stage bladder cancer lesions. Results: Our experiments demonstrate that the BTS-Net we developed has outperformed other method on the external B validation dataset, achieving a MPrecision of 91.39%, a MRecall of 95.71%, a MIoU of 88.18% and an F1-score of 93.18%. The BTS-Net showed high accuracy with real-time processing speed at 23 fps. Conclusion: Missed detection of satellite lesions in early bladder tumors often leads to tumor recurrence. Our BTS-Net is capable of segmenting all potential satellite lesions in surgical videos, without the need for complex professional equipment. This AI-assisted diagnosis system has the potential to improve surgical outcomes by ensuring comprehensive treatment of all tumor-related areas during TURBT.

Patient falls are a frequent safety issue in inpatient rehabilitation settings, especially during early admission days when patients face physical limitations and unfamiliar environments. This study reveals high-risk periods for falls that align with peak patient activities and staff shift changes. The findings suggest that targeted fall prevention strategies during these times could significantly enhance patient safety and optimize staff resources in rehabilitation facilities. Falls are a significant safety concern in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, where patients often face increased risk due to functional impairments. This retrospective study examined fall trends across days after admission and daily 2-hr intervals within a single rehabilitation hospital. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant decline in fall rates over time, suggesting a decrease in fall risk as patients acclimate and improve physically. However, two peak periods for falls were identified during early morning and evening hours, aligning with heightened patient activity and staff shift changes. These findings emphasize the need for targeted fall prevention strategies during the initial days after admission and specific high-risk times of the day. Implementing tailored interventions for these critical periods may reduce fall incidents and enhance patient safety in rehabilitation settings.

Inpatient falls are a significant health concern, leading to increased hospital stays, costs, and potential severe injuries or death. This study aims to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and challenges of inpatient falls in Firoozgar hospital . This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran. The study included all patients who experienced a fall incident in Firoozgar hospital between April 2023 and March 2024. We included 90 patients with an average age of 57.49 years. Falls were more prevalent among men, older patients, and individuals with lower education levels. Underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and addiction significantly increased the risk of falls. Identifying the specific causes of falls in each hospital ward can facilitate the development of targeted preventive strategies. Implementing environmental modifications and fall prevention measures could substantially reduce fall risks, enhance patient safety, and lower healthcare costs.

Background and Objectives Falls are an increasing problem among older adults. Older adults' self-report of falls is the primary method of fall risk identification. However, up to 72% of Medicare beneficiaries who have fallen do not report falls and fall-related injuries to their healthcare providers. Research suggests that older adults prefer the term "balance problems" instead of "fall risk." The purpose of this study was to examine if perceived balance problem is a predictor of self-reported falls after controlling for known predictors of falls among older adults. Research Design and Methods The Health Belief Model served as the theoretical framework. A longitudinal secondary analysis was conducted using data from a subsample of independently living participants (N = 5,446) from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Baseline data was from the year 2015, and the outcome was self-reported falls in 2016. Results Complex samples multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the single item perceived balance problem question (odds ratios, OR = 1.69, p < .001) predicted falls in 2016, whereas, the balance performance measure, Short Physical Performance Battery, did not (OR = 0.98, p = .06). Non-Hispanic White participants were more likely to report falling compared to non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants, as were females compared to males. A hospital stay in 2015, comorbidities, fear of falling, and a fall in 2015 were also predictive of falls. Discussion and Implications Assessing older adults' perceived balance is important in primary care to identify fall risk and recommend appropriate home modifications, assistive devices, and/or interventions.

Tools for Immediate and short-term outcomes of in-hospital canagliflozin initiation in acute heart failure: Results from the CANA-AHF randomized clinical trial.

Immediate and short-term outcomes of in-hospital canagliflozin initiation in acute heart failure: Results from the CANA-AHF randomized clinical trial.

• Limited data is available related to the early initiation of canagliflozin in AHF patients. • A prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, randomized equivalence trial aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of early canagliflozin initiation compared to empagliflozin in hospitalized AHF patients with volume overload, regardless of their diabetic status. • Canagliflozin was equivalent to empagliflozin in diuresis effect. Canagliflozin also resulted in comparable decreases in congestion and NT-proBNP levels, lowering HF events and enhancing patients' quality of life. • When compared to empagliflozin, canagliflozin was both safe and well tolerated in AHF patients. Early initiation of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in acute heart failure (AHF) patients increases urine output, reduces hospital stays, and enhances quality of life post-hospital discharge. This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of early canagliflozin initiation compared to empagliflozin in hospitalized AHF patients with volume overload. This was a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, randomized equivalence trial. AHF diabetic and non-diabetic patients were randomized within 24 h from hospital admission to either receive 100 mg canagliflozin or 10 mg empagliflozin in addition to the standardized protocol for an intravenous loop diuretic. The primary outcome was the median of daily diuresis during the hospitalization period. Hospitalized AHF patients were enrolled (71 patients per group). The median daily diuresis during the hospitalization period was 4200 ml in the canagliflozin group, which was statistically equivalent to empagliflozin (4117 ml) with a difference of 83 ml, which falls within the predefined equivalence margin (±10) % of the median of daily diuresis of empagliflozin; Δ = ±411.7 mL), confirming equivalence via bootstrap TSOT p < 0.001. No difference was observed in diuretic response, dyspnea score, orthodema congestion score or length of hospital stay. The NT-proBNP level at day 30 post-discharge and the change in KCCQ-TSS from baseline to day 90 were statistically comparable between both groups, without differences in safety event incidence.

Tools for Adherence to optimal delirium management practices in intensive care units in Brazil: a nationwide survey.

Adherence to optimal delirium management practices in intensive care units in Brazil: a nationwide survey.
By:Bispo, Mateus Meneses;da Silva Souza, Regina ClaudiaIn:JBI Evidence Implementation, Jul2025, volume 23, issue 3, pages 345-354 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Effective delirium management is crucial, considering its association with adverse outcomes. Adherence to best practices has the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of delirium and improve health outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this project were to describe self-assessed adherence to best practices in delirium management by health care professionals in intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil, assess the health care professionals' perception of the importance of adequate delirium prevention and treatment in ICUs, and compare the compliance rates with best practices between public and private ICUs. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Brazil using an online questionnaire consisting of three parts, namely, data about the health care professionals and the ICU in which they worked; statements about the 17 best practices; and questions related to perceptions of delirium prevention and management by ICU physicians and nurses. The survey was sent to email addresses registered with the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine. Results: The compliance rate exceeded 50% for only eight best practices. These included the identification and management of pressure sores and falls in delirium patients, with compliance rates of 77.8% and 74.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Among ICU professionals in Brazil, adherence to best practices in delirium management is low, particularly for practices involving patient education and involvement of their relatives in their care. These results emphasize the importance of enhancing delirium management in Brazilian health care institutions, regardless of hospital classification. http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/IJEBH/A274

Tools for Evaluation of the Implementation of Low‐Low Hospital Beds With Respect to Fall Frequency and Patient Harms: A Retrospective Analysis.

Evaluation of the Implementation of Low‐Low Hospital Beds With Respect to Fall Frequency and Patient Harms: A Retrospective Analysis.
By:Ryan, Daniel;Neenan, Sue;Jablonski, Kim;+3 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Jul2025, volume 81, issue 7, pages 3786-3797 (12p)CINAHL
Aim: To identify whether the introduction of low‐low hospital beds resulted in changes in the incidence, associated patient harms and event characteristics of bed‐related falls where implemented. Design: This retrospective quality improvement study covered 36 months: 18 months pre‐intervention and 18 months post‐intervention. Methods: Our analysis incorporated patient fall data from a hospital in upstate New York. Pre‐/post‐intervention data covered 18 months on either side of introduction at the units of implementation. Data were sourced from contemporaneously recorded incident reports and the organisation's business intelligence records. Analysis addressed the incidence rate, frequency, patient harm classification and recurrence of bed‐related falls, as well as Morse Fall Scale risk classification, patient age, gender and other individualised risk factors. Lastly, we reviewed the presence of individualised interventions, staff assistance during the event, patient census and staffing ratios. Chi‐square goodness of fit tests were employed to compare the distribution, and Brunner‐Munzel tests the stochastic equality, of the pre‐ and post‐implementation categorical and continuous data. Results: There were no significant differences in the incidence rate of bed‐related falls, patient harms or in the need for medical intervention following implementation of the low‐low hospital beds. Neither were there any significant differences in the proportion of events resulting in detectable harm or the need for medical intervention post‐implementation. The total number of bed‐involved falls substantively increased following implementation of the low‐low beds, as did the number of events resulting in detectable harms and medical intervention. Among these, substantive increases were noted among events resulting in minor temporary harm and patients referred for diagnostic imaging. The number of events involved patients experiencing recurrent falls of any kind increased significantly post‐implementation. Conclusion: We found that the introduction of low‐low hospital beds preceded no change in the incidence of bed‐related falls, associated patient harms or the need for post‐event medical intervention where implemented. While data limitations precluded definitive determination with respect to certain event characteristics, several post‐implementation changes, including substantive increases in the number of falls occurring during ingress and egress, may suggest a potential for relationship worthy of future study. Implications and Impact: Low‐low hospital beds are purported to help reduce the occurrence and severity of bed‐related falls, both serious problems in inpatient settings. This study describes null outcomes following an implementation of such beds, with implications for adoption in similar settings. Reporting Method: We adhered to the relevant Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research guidelines, specifically following the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence standards. Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public involvement in the design or conduct of the study. Nurses and medical staff were involved in intervention implementation, data collection and the conception, design and conduct of the study.

Tools for Neurological Nurses' Perspectives on Communication of Stroke Recurrence Risks: A Mixed‐Method Study.

Neurological Nurses' Perspectives on Communication of Stroke Recurrence Risks: A Mixed‐Method Study.
By:Lin, Beilei;Jin, Yujia;Qiu, Yunjing;+5 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Jul2025, volume 81, issue 7, pages 4258-4270 (13p)CINAHL
Aim: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the practices, attitudes, and thoughts of neurological nurses regarding communication about the risk of stroke recurrence. Design: This is a mixed‐method study with a sequential explanatory design. Methods: An electronic survey was conducted amongst 280 neurological nurses from 30 hospitals to explore their clinical practice and attitudes towards stroke recurrence risk communication (RC). Furthermore, 10 nurses' from three tertiary hospitals were interviewed using a convenience sampling approach, and data were analysed with Colaizzi's methods. Results: Most neurological nurses view recurrence RC essential and beneficial. Quantitative results indicated that nurses frequently discuss warning symptoms, risk factors, the likelihood, and severity of stroke recurrence with patients. However, qualitative analysis indicated that these communications are often non‐standardised, with cautious language, use of informal language, non‐fixed timing, and limited focus on structured communication strategies. Factors influencing communication practices span three levels: the nurse, the patient, and the organisation. Influencing factors fall into three categories: nurse‐related (age, education, experience, confidence, and knowledge), patient‐related (trust and preferences), and organisational (lack of standardised models for communication). Conclusions: Although neurological nurses recognise the significance of recurrence RC, their skills in this area could benefit from further development. Developing training and supporting nurses in delivering effective stroke recurrence risk education independently or in collaboration with physicians is crucial. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care: The findings highlight the necessity of standardising stroke recurrence RC, including the development of assessment tools, training programs, and communication strategies. These are essential for optimising risk education in stroke secondary prevention and promoting effective cardiovascular RC in clinical practice. Reporting Method: This study adhered to the GRAMMS checklist. Patient or Public Contribution: Not applicable. Trail Registration: CTR2000034244

The effects of dynamic flamingo balance exercises and balance training with a Tetrax ® posturography device on the balance performance and fall risk of patients with Parkinson's disease.
By:Karagül, Sevil;Kartaloğlu, Işıl FaziletIn:Journal of Back & Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation, Jul2025, volume 38, issue 4, pages 766-773 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Balance disorder is more prevalent in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study aimed to examine the effects of flamingo balance exercises and balance training with Tetrax® Interactive Balance System (TIBS) (Sunlight Medical Ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel) on the balance performance and fall risk of patients with PD. Methods: This randomized-controlled, single-blind, prospective study was performed at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Istanbul Atakent Acıbadem Hospital, Turkey, between September 2022 and January 2023. One hundred twenty-four patients were randomly divided into four groups: (1) balance training group with TIBS (n = 31), (2) flamingo training group (n = 32), (3) combined training group (n = 31), and (4) control group (n = 30). All participants trained 3 days a week for 6 weeks, with patient-specific training. Trial groups were evaluated with pre-treatment and post-treatment. Results: After the treatment, there was a statistically significant difference in all balance and fall scores in patients who received alternate balance training (p < 0.05). The balance and falling values in the combined training group were superior to single-type training groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dynamic flamingo therapy combined with balance exercises with a static posturography device improves balance disorder in PD patients compared to therapy restricted to individual training.

Tools for Integration of Palliative Care Screening Tools for End-Stage Liver Patients to Improve End-of-Life Care.

Integration of Palliative Care Screening Tools for End-Stage Liver Patients to Improve End-of-Life Care.
By:Gaines, Susanne;Satyshur, Rosemarie D.;Fitzpatrick, SuzannaIn:Journal of Doctoral Nursing Practice, 2025, volume 18, issue 2, pages 143-153 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Liver disease is often associated with high symptom burden and long hospital stay, leading to a decreased quality of life. For patients considered unsuitable for transplantation, the alternative treatment options are supportive management and palliative care (PC). The most significant barrier to early PC is the failure to identify patients who may benefit from it. Currently, transplant healthcare professionals have limited PC education as well as a limited understanding of primary PC and PC service flow. Objective: The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project is to identify nontransplantable liver disease (NTLD) patients' unidentified unmet PC needs, utilizing two validated tools Necesidades Paliativas Palliative Needs (NECPAL) and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), and integrate them within routine nursing care activities in the transplant unit to increase pain and symptom management. Methods: This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project was integrated into a QI project over 12 weeks in the Fall of 2019. Transplant nurses and nurse practitioners (NPs) completed the tools for every NTLD patient to identify patients in need of PC and to assist identification of end-of-life symptoms to determine the quality of life. Results: A total of 5 NPs and 10 staff nurses received education and training on the NECPAL and CLDQ tools from the DNP project leader. Sixteen nontransplant liver disease patients, aged 29–68 years, median age of 52 years, majority being (69%) female, participated. The percentage of patients who completed the CLDQ and reported symptoms of unmet needs was an average of 80%. The most common symptoms reported were abdominal bloating and discomfort, worrying, and family impact. The goal was for all nurses and NPs to complete the screen tool 100% of the time. The percentage of patients completing the NECPAL, at an average of 60%, indicated a need for integrating PC. Conclusions: Implementation of NECPAL and CLDQ tools identified multiple unmet PC needs in NTLD patients. Nurses and NPs reported the tool was easy to use in identifying symptoms and clinical indicators for the identification of unmet PC needs and to promote incorporation into routine nursing care in liver disease patients who were deemed nontransplantable and allowed nurses to advocate for symptom and pain management with objective validated tools. Implications for Nursing: The NECPAL and CLDQ screening tools can identify clinical symptoms and the need for integration of PC. Incorporating PC needs promotes optimal end-stage quality of life for patients and their families. Ongoing training for NPs and nursing staff is needed to continue providing identification of patient PC needs. These nurse-initiated screening PC tools can be easily implemented in other units caring for patients with chronic and/or end-stage diseases to improve symptom management and end-of-life care.

By:Almwuad'a, Mohammed Hussein H.In:Journal of Musculoskeletal Surgery & Research (JMSR), Jul-Sep2025, volume 9, issue 3, pages 1-6 (6p)CINAHL
Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the functional outcomes and complications of open distal femur fractures treated with primary open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a locking compression plate (LCP) after debridement and wound irrigation. Methods: This prospective study included 53 patients with open distal femur fractures from May 2018 to May 2023. Inclusion criteria were open fractures requiring surgery, excluding skeletally immature patients, those with gunshot wounds, or polytrauma. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using an LCP and Sanders' Functional Evaluation Scale assessed outcomes. Results: The study consisted of 41 males (77.4%) and 12 females (22.6%) with an average age of 33.3 years. Most injuries (75.5%) were due to road traffic accidents, followed by falls (15%) and industry/farm-related injuries (9.4%). The Gustilo-Anderson classification revealed 54.7% type 1, 32.1% type 2, and 13.2% type 3A fractures. Bone union was achieved in 77.4% of patients, with an average union time of 5.6 months. The average knee flexion was 87.16 ± 20°, with a mean of 104.8°. Based on Sander's score, functional outcomes were excellent in 35.8% of patients, good in 39.6%, fair in 13.2%, and poor in 11.3%. Complications included delayed union (9.4%), surgical site infections (13.2%), deep vein thrombosis (5.7%), and knee stiffness (3.8%). Conclusion: Primary ORIF with LCP for open distal femur fractures leads to satisfactory functional outcomes in most cases. Early mobilization and proper postoperative care help reduce complications.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between new graduate RN (NGRN) saturation and nurse-sensitive patient outcomes and experiences. BACKGROUND: Many nurse leaders believe that the number of NGRNs should be limited to ensure high-quality care. To our knowledge, there is no previous evidence quantifying the impact of NGRNs' saturation on patient outcomes. METHODS: Researchers analyzed nurse staffing metrics and patient outcomes from 79 distinct medical-surgical units within 22 hospitals, from 2017 to 2022. Outcomes included fall rates, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line–associated bloodstream infections extracted from the electronic health record, and patient experience metrics collected via survey. RESULTS: The researchers identified no statistically significant relationships between NGRN saturation and patient outcomes or experiences. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support limiting the number of NGRNs on medical-surgical units out of concern for negative impact on nurse-sensitive quality of care outcomes.

Tools for Global Prevalence, Incidence, and Factors Influencing Falls in Older Adults With Dementia: Implications for Nursing and Healthy Aging.

Global Prevalence, Incidence, and Factors Influencing Falls in Older Adults With Dementia: Implications for Nursing and Healthy Aging.
By:Octary, Tiara;Sung, Chien‐Mei;Chen, Ruey;+5 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Scholarship, Jul2025, volume 57, issue 4, pages 678-694 (17p)CINAHL
Introduction: Dementia notably increases fall risk in older adults, leading to major injuries and considerable concerns from health‐care professionals. However, comprehensive evidence regarding the prevalence, incidence rate, and moderating factors of falls in institutional settings is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, incidence rates, and moderating factors of falls among older adults with dementia in nursing homes and dementia‐specialized care units. Design: A meta‐analysis. Methods: We searched CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from database inception to April 30, 2024. Older adults with dementia in nursing homes or dementia‐specialized care units were included. The pooled prevalence was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with random effects using R software. Incidence rates were reported per person‐year using comprehensive meta‐analysis software. Study quality was assessed using Hoy's criteria. Variations in the pooled prevalence of falls were explored through moderator analyses. Results: This meta‐analysis included 21 studies involving 35,449 participants. The pooled prevalence of falls was 45.6%, with subtypes showing 39.2%, 35.2%, and 29.0% among Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia subtypes, respectively. Falls were more prevalent in dementia‐specialized care units (53.0%) than in nursing homes (42.6%). The overall incidence rate was 3.61 per person‐year, higher in dementia‐specialized care units (5.80) than in nursing homes (3.17). Subgroup analyses revealed higher fall prevalence in women (70.0%) than in men (30.6%). Meta‐regression indicated that comorbidities, including delirium, visual impairment, and arthritis, increased fall risk. Conclusions: This meta‐analysis revealed a high incidence of falls in nearly half of older adults with dementia, particularly among those in dementia specialized care units. Clinical Relevance: Healthcare professionals should prioritize regular fall risk assessments, tailored interventions, and environmental safety modifications, particularly in dementia‐specialized care units, to reduce fall‐related injuries and improve patient outcomes.

The article focuses on a poignant interaction between a caregiver and a young boy in a hospital room, who expresses a deep connection to the stars, particularly Albireo, a double star. The boy, who is dependent on oxygen and medical equipment, shares that Albireo reminds him of his bond with his brother, despite their physical separation. As night falls, the caregiver creates a calming atmosphere by dimming the lights and allowing the boy to point out stars that hold personal significance. The piece concludes with the caregiver reflecting on the beauty of Albireo as they step outside after their shift.

Background: Discharge work is part of the organizational work carried out by nurses. The length of stay in Norwegian hospitals has decreased significantly due to the 2012 Coordination Reform, resulting in a greater proportion of patients being ready for discharge to municipal services. Transferring a patient from hospital to municipality poses a risk that unwanted incidents may occur. Purpose: To examine nurses' experiences with discharging patients from hospital to municipal home care services and their experiences of collaborating in discharge work. Method: A qualitative design with six focus group interviews of nurses at one hospital and in two municipalities. The data material was analysed using systematic text condensation. Results: The analysis revealed three main themes: 1) Discharge work: extensive, perceived as unclear, burdensome and unpredictable; 2) Communication in coordination: cumbersome, inadequate and endless; and 3) Work to ensure correct drug list: inadequate access, resource-intensive, promotes patient safety. Conclusion: Nurses' discharge work involves a significant amount of invisible work. Nurses find discharge work stressful. However, they display great responsibility and flexibility in ensuring the safe transition of patients. The question, whether overall responsibility for coordinating safe transitions of patients between hospital and municipal health services should fall on nurses needs to be discussed.

Tools for Prevalence and Risk Factors of Recurrent Falls in Older People Post-Hip Fracture Surgery After Discharge: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Prevalence and Risk Factors of Recurrent Falls in Older People Post-Hip Fracture Surgery After Discharge: A Cross-Sectional Study.
By:Phonlakid, Pitchaya;Roopsawang, Inthira;Aree-Ue, SuparbIn:Pacific Rim International Journal of Nursing Research, Jul-Sep2025, volume 29, issue 3, pages 543-557 (15p)CINAHL
Recurrent falls and fall-related injuries are common in older adults after a hip fracture. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with recurrent falls in older people following hip fracture surgery after their discharge from the hospital. With purposive sampling, the participants were 180 older adults who underwent hip fracture surgery six months prior and visited orthopedic outpatient services at three tertiary care hospitals in Bangkok from July 2023 to May 2024. Data collection utilized standard assessments, including the Personal Health Information Questionnaire, the 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test, the Hip Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, the Falls Efficacy Scale International, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the St Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression, with a significant level set at 0.05. The results indicated that the prevalence of recurrent falls among older people who underwent hip fracture surgery was 27.8% within the first six months after being discharged from the hospital. Participants identified as high risk for falls had a risk of recurrent falls that was 4.74 times greater than those classified as low risk. Additionally, participants taking medications related to falls had a 2.71 times higher risk of experiencing recurrent falls compared to those who were not on such medications. Findings from this study suggest that health professionals, particularly gerontological nurse practitioners, should emphasize the importance of assessing fall risks and the potential side effects of medications that could lead to falls before discharging patients from the hospital.

Tools for The Predictive Value of Baseline Spirometry, Age, and Gender for Airway Hyper-Responsiveness in Adults With Suspected Asthma.

The Predictive Value of Baseline Spirometry, Age, and Gender for Airway Hyper-Responsiveness in Adults With Suspected Asthma.
By:Wei, Sulan;Zhao, Zhen;Zhu, Guiping;+7 moreIn:Respiratory Care, Jul2025, volume 70, issue 7, pages 847-854 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Bronchial provocation test (BPT) plays a crucial role in diagnosing airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) among patients with asthma-like symptoms. Given that BPT may induce severe bronchospasm, baseline spirometric parameters are expected to help predict a positive outcome, guiding the decision of referring a patient to BPT. Methods: Baseline spirometry and BPT conducted on suspected asthmatics between July 2011 and 2013 at Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, were retrospectively collected. Baseline characteristics from positive and negative BPT groups were compared. The predictive accuracy of single parameter for AHR was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curve, and a composite model was developed to improve the accuracy by the logistic regression. The relationships of FEV1/FVC, FEV1 %predicted, and forced expiratory flow at 50% of FVC exhaled (FEF50 %predicted) with the provocation dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20-FEV1) were examined. Results: The positive BPT group exhibited reduced FEV1 %predicted, FEV1/FVC, and small airway function parameters compared with the negative group. Among these parameters, FEF50 %predicted, forced expiratory flow at 75% of FVC exhaled (FEF75 %predicted), and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75 %predicted) demonstrated significant accuracy. Notably, females and younger subjects were more prone to a positive outcome. A predictive model that combined FEV1 %predicted (cutoff 98.65%, area under the curve 0.714, sensitivity 39.10%, specificity 88.10%), FEV1/FVC (cutoff 79.22%, area under the curve 0.690, sensitivity 32.80%, specificity 90.50%), and FEF50 %predicted (cutoff 74.45%, area under the curve 0.761, sensitivity 50.50%, specificity 84.60%) with age and gender was found to enhance the accuracy for a positive BPT (area under the curve 0.786, 95% CI 0.758–0.814, sensitivity 52.27%, specificity 86.14%). Moreover, FEV1/FVC, FEF50 %predicted, and FEF25-75 %predicted showed differences among groups with varying AHR levels. The significant correlations between these 3 parameters and PD20-FEV1 were exclusively demonstrated in the severe AHR group. Conclusions: This study revealed that FEV1 %predicted, FEV1/FVC, and FEF50 %predicted along with age and gender were predictors of AHR in subjects with suspected asthma. Their combination improved the predictive accuracy over using FEF50 %predicted alone, thus offering a complement for clinical decision-making regarding referrals to BPT.

Older adults with cervical spine fractures – Epidemiology, management and outcomes from a level 1 trauma centre.
By:Kimmel, Lara A;Kirk, Asher;Broderick, Shane;+3 moreIn:Trauma, Jul2025, volume 27, issue 3, pages 218-224 (7p)CINAHL
Introduction: Cervical spine fractures are common in older adults, although reports of the epidemiology and outcomes of this patient cohort are scant. The aim of this study was to review the epidemiology, management and outcomes (hospital-based and patient-reported) of older patients with cervical fractures admitted to a level 1 trauma centre. Methods: Patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted to The Alfred and included on the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR) with a cervical spine fracture were included. Demographics and management (surgery, halo thoracic orthosis or conservative), as well as hospital and 6-month outcomes were analysed. Factors associated with cervical spine management and outcomes (discharge destination and being at home at 6 months post-injury) were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Between 2016 and 2021, a total of 853 patients were included. Median age was 79 (IQR 72–86) years, with most (57.7%) being male. Low falls (59%) were common. Most patients were managed non-operatively [765 (89%)]. The median acute hospital length of stay was 6.8 (IQR 3.8–11.6) days and 90.6% of patients survived to hospital discharge. After adjusting for confounding factors, increasing age, female gender and having an intensive care unit stay were associated with discharge to another inpatient facility as well as not returning to live at home at 6 months. There was no association between the cervical spine management and 6-month quality of life outcomes. Conclusion: Overall mortality rate was low with most patients returning to independent living at home 6 months post-injury. Considering those factors associated with poorer outcomes may provide useful information to determine optimal pathways for this cohort.

Tools for Splenic lacerations: a retrospective analysis of management strategies and clinical outcomes.

Splenic lacerations: a retrospective analysis of management strategies and clinical outcomes.
By:Değirmencioğlu, Gürkan;Kütük, Deniz;Çanakci, Mehmet Hanifi;+4 moreIn:Turkish Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery / Ulusal Travma ve Acil Cerrahi Dergisi, Jul2025, volume 31, issue 7, pages 644-650 (7p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Splenic injuries are among the most frequently encountered conditions in abdominal trauma. In such cases, the treatment approach must be carefully determined based on the patient's hemodynamic stability, the severity of the injury, and the presence of associated intra-abdominal pathologies, typically requiring a choice between non-operative management (NOM) and surgical intervention. The decision-making process is primarily guided by hemodynamic status, injury grade, and imaging findings. This study evaluates clinical outcomes and the factors influencing treatment decisions in patients with splenic rupture who were referred from the emergency department to the general surgery unit. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 42 patients diagnosed with splenic injury between June 2023 and February 2025. Patients were divided into two groups: those who received NOM (n=29, 69.0%) and those who underwent operative management (OM) (n=13, 31.0%). Demographics, mechanisms of injury, hemodynamic status, laboratory results, imaging findings, transfusion requirements, length of hospital stay, and mortality rates were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were made using appropriate tests, with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 38.3±19.4 years, with 76.2% being male. The leading cause of injury was vehicular accidents (47.6%), followed by falls (21.4%) and penetrating trauma (11.9%). Operative management was more common in sharp object penetrating injuries (SOPI) (15.4%) and gunshot wounds (7.7%). Hemodynamic instability was more frequent in the OM group compared to the NOM group (30.8% vs. 10.3%, p=0.149). Splenectomy was performed in 76.9% of surgical cases (p=0.003). Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed that Grade 1 injuries (55.2%) were predominant in the NOM group, while Grade 2 injuries (38.5%) were more common in the OM group (p=0.531). The OM group required more blood transfusions (2.6±3.0 units vs. 0.9±1.9 units, p=0.053) and had longer hospital stays (10.3±6.9 days vs. 5.7±4.9 days, p=0.042). Overall mortality was low (9.5%), with no significant difference between the groups (p=0.819). CONCLUSION: Non-operative management is the preferred approach for hemodynamically stable patients, offering favorable outcomes and shorter hospital stays. However, penetrating trauma and hemodynamic instability are strong predictors for surgical intervention. Early risk stratification and close clinical monitoring are essential in determining the most appropriate treatment strategy for splenic injuries. AMAÇ: Dalak yaralanmaları, en sık görülen karın travmaları arasında yer alır ve cerrahi dışı tedavi (NOM) ile cerrahi müdahale arasında bir denge gerektirir. Karar verme süreci, hemodinamik stabilite, yaralanmanın şiddeti ve görüntüleme bulgularına bağlıdır. Bu çalışma, acil servisten genel cerrahi birimine sevk edilen dalak rüptürlü hastalarda klinik sonuçları ve tedavi kararlarını etkileyen faktörleri değerlendirmektedir. GEREÇ VE YÖNTEM: Haziran 2023 ile Şubat 2025 arasında dalak yaralanması tanısı alan 42 hasta üzerinde retrospektif bir kohort çalışması yapıldı. Hastalar, cerrahi dışı tedavi (n=29, %69.0) ve cerrahi tedavi (n=13, %31.0) gruplarına ayrıldı. Demografik özellikler, yaralanma mekanizmaları, hemodinamik durum, laboratuvar sonuçları, görüntüleme bulguları, transfüzyon ihtiyacı, hastanede kalış süresi ve mortalite oranları incelendi. İstatistiksel karşılaştırmalar, anlamlılık düzeyi p<0.05 olacak şekilde uygun testler kullanılarak yapıldı. BULGULAR: Ortalama yaş 38.3±19.4 yıl olup, hastaların %76,2'si erkekti. Yaralanmaların en yaygın nedeni trafik kazaları (%47.6), bunu düşmeler (%21.4) ve penetran travmalar (%11.9) izledi. Cerrahi tedavi, bıçak yaralanmalarında (%15.4) ve ateşli silah yaralanmalarında (%7.7) daha sık uygulandı. Hemodinamik instabilite, cerrahi tedavi grubunda daha yaygındı (%30.8'e karşı %10.3, p=0.149). Cerrahi vakaların %76.9'unda splenektomi yapıldı (p=0.003). BT görüntülemede, cerrahi dışı tedavi grubunda en sık evre 1 yaralanmalar (%55.2) görülürken, cerrahi tedavi grubunda evre 2 yaralanmalar (%38.5) daha yaygındı (p=0.531). Cerrahi tedavi alan grupta daha fazla kan transfüzyonu gerekti (2.6±3.0 üniteye karşı 0.9±1.9 ünite, p=0.053) ve hastanede kalış süreleri daha uzundu (10.3±6.9 güne karşı 5.7±4.9 gün, p=0.042). Mortalite oranı düşüktü (%9.5) ve gruplar arasında anlamlı fark yoktu (p=0.819). SONUÇ: Hemodinamik olarak stabil hastalarda tercih edilen yaklaşım cerrahi dışı tedavi (NOM) olup, bu yöntem olumlu klinik sonuçlar ve daha kısa hastanede kalış süreleri sağlamaktadır. Bununla birlikte, penetran travma ve hemodinamik instabilite cerrahi müdahale için güçlü belirteçlerdir. Dalak yaralanmalarında optimal tedavi stratejisinin belirlenmesi için erken risk sınıflandırması ve yakın takip kritik öneme sahiptir.

Tools for Residential medication management reviews: a call for improved collaboration and systems integration in aged care.

Residential medication management reviews: a call for improved collaboration and systems integration in aged care.
By:Richardson, Heather;Payne, Angela;Richardson, Emily;+5 moreIn:Working with Older People: Community Care Policy & Practice, 2025, volume 29, issue 3, pages 247-253 (7p)CINAHL
Purpose: Residential Medication Management Reviews (RMMR) are a key component of safe, high-quality aged care service delivery. The RMMR is an interdisciplinary approach to medication management that relies on collaboration, communication and integration of systems. Acting as an improvement opportunity, the purpose of this paper is to present findings from a regional study, aimed at assessing the impact of RMMR on falls and hospital admissions and identifies barriers to impactful research in this area. Design/methodology/approach: A three-year retrospective quantitative longitudinal practice audit was conducted in a regional state-managed high-care residential facility in Queensland, Australia. Data was collected pre-RMMR and six months post-RMMR. Findings: The data collected was insufficient to achieve statistical significance or demonstrate the impact of RMMR on health outcomes. Factors impeding the research included limited ability to collect the data due to the lack of integration of information systems and limited stakeholder engagement resulting in poor recruitment. This highlights the need for improvement in RMMR processes and practices, and indeed wider research collaboration in the aged care sector. Research limitations/implications: Thís paper acts as a call to action to improve research and interprofessional collaboration in Australian aged care. Originality/value: The aged care industry needs high-quality research to drive practice improvement and collaborative care and service delivery. This paper advocates for improvements in the aged care sector with respect to research engagement and communication pathways between service providers. Advancement in systems integration for information sharing, recruitment of participants and stakeholder engagement will support evidence-based practice and process change.

Tools for Sex-stratified patterns in geriatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury and intracranial bleeding: a retrospective cohort study.

Sex-stratified patterns in geriatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury and intracranial bleeding: a retrospective cohort study.
By:Sedlak, Marian;Hutnanova, Kornelia;Petras, Tomas;+5 moreIn:International Journal of Emergency Medicine, 06/19/2025, volume 18, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common diagnosis among elderly patients treated in emergency departments. It is often complicated by age-related physiological changes such as brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and frailty. While sex differences are increasingly recognized in TBI pathophysiology and clinical management, limited research has explored their impact on geriatric mTBI complicated by intracranial bleeding. This study aimed to investigate sex-stratified patterns in injury mechanisms, clinical presentation, and associated injuries among older adults with mTBI. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study of geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) hospitalized at the Louis Pasteur University Hospital in Košice, Slovakia with mTBI complicated by intracranial bleeding over a 30-month period (July 2022– December 2024). Patient data were extracted from electronic health records, including demographic characteristics, injury mechanisms, symptomatology, radiological findings, and clinical outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive and comparative methods. Results: A total of 117 patients (55 females, 62 males) met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 77.0 years (IQR: 12.0), with females presenting at a higher median age than males (80 vs. 75.5 years). Causes of injury differed significantly between sexes (p < 0.001); while mechanical falls were predominant in both groups, alcohol-related injuries were significantly more common in males (37.1% vs. 7.3%). Symptom presentation also varied, with females exhibiting a higher prevalence of multiple symptoms, while males more frequently reported amnesia or loss of consciousness (p = 0.029). Additional injuries showed sex-related differences, with skull fractures more prevalent in males (41.9% vs. 21.8%) and pelvic (0 vs. 7.3%) or upper limb fractures (0 vs. 12.7%) more common in females (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Sex-based differences in the presentation and symptomatology of geriatric patients with mTBI and intracranial bleeding highlight the need for tailored diagnostic and management approaches. Recognizing these differences could improve clinical assessment and individualized care. Further research is needed to refine sex-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this vulnerable population.

Tools for Is level 1 trauma care necessary for all severely injured older patients? Evaluating undertriage and feasibility of care in major and non-major trauma centres in the Netherlands.

Is level 1 trauma care necessary for all severely injured older patients? Evaluating undertriage and feasibility of care in major and non-major trauma centres in the Netherlands.
By:van Ameijden, Sara;Boele van Hensbroek, Pieter;Boersma, Doeke;+3 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, 06/16/2025, volume 51, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Purpose: Undertriage remains a challenge within the severely injured older patients. The survival benefit in major trauma centres (MTCs) compared to non-major trauma centres (nMTCs) has been disputed. This study aimed to assess the differences in patient characteristics of severely injured older patients treated in MTCs and nMTCs and to regard whether these characteristics could be related to pre-hospital triage decisions and influence clinical outcomes in MTCs and nMTCs. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, using the Dutch National Trauma Registry to identify all patients of 70 and above with an ISS ≥ 16 during 2016–2022. Patient characteristics and outcomes between MTCs, nMTCs and directly transferred patients were compared. Backward logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting mortality. Results: A total of 10,899 patients were included. Patients in nMTCs harboured more octo- and nonagenarians than MTCs (44.6% vs. 37.2% and 15.1% vs. 6.7% resp., p < 0.001). The ISS was significantly lower in nMTCs (median 19 [IQR 17–25] vs. 22 [17–27], p < 0.001), with severe head injury and a low GCS being more prevalent in MTCs. High energy falls were more often observed in MTCs (15.6% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.001). Mortality was significantly lower in nMTCs (OR 0.59, 95%-CI 0.54–0.65), with a GCS 3–8 strongly associated with an increased risk for mortality in both nMTCs and MTCs (OR 19.93, p < 0.001 and OR 7.87, p < 0.001 resp.). Conclusion: The differences in patients presented in MTCs and nMTCs indicate factors contributing to undertriage; severely injured older patients with recognizable injuries and trauma mechanisms are more likely to be presented in a MTC. Whether feasible care for severely injured older patients should be provided in MTCs or nMTCs should not only be dependent on ISS and mortality rates; patient-centred care goals harbouring broader perspectives as frailty and health- and quality-of-life benefit of aggressive injury treatment should also contribute in triage- and treatment decision-making. Level of evidence and study type: Level III, prognostic/epidemiological.

Tools for Laboratory frailty index improves prediction of in-hospital falls among older adults.

Laboratory frailty index improves prediction of in-hospital falls among older adults.
By:Nakashima, Hirotaka;Imaizumi, Takahiro;Komiya, Hitoshi;+6 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, 05/06/2025, volume 37, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Aims: To explore the association between Frailty Index based on laboratory tests (FI-lab) and in-hospital fall risk in older adults, and to explore whether incorporating FI-lab improves the predictive accuracy of a traditional fall risk prediction tool. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from patients aged ≥ 60 years who were admitted to Nagoya University Hospital in 2020. We assessed fall risk using the St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients (STRATIFY). We calculated FI-lab based on 35 common laboratory parameters tested on admission. Each fall was reported prospectively by nurses through computer-based incident report forms. The relationship between FI-lab and in-hospital falls was analyzed using multivariate binomial logistic regression. Predictive performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Missing data were not imputed and internal validation used 1000-bootstrap optimism-correction. Results: Data for 5984 patients were included (mean age 73 years, 63.5% male). The mean FI-lab score was 0.31 ± 0.16. Falls occurred in 175 patients (2.9%) during a median hospital stay of 9 days. FI-lab was associated with falls independently of STRATIFY. Adding FI-lab to STRATIFY significantly improved its predictive accuracy, increasing AUROC from 0.674 to 0.715 (p = 0.018), with NRI of 0.413 (p < 0.001). Calibration slope after internal validation was 0.97. Conclusions: FI-lab on admission was independently associated with in-hospital fall risk and improved the predictive ability of STRATIFY. FI-lab could be a valuable component in more accurate fall prediction.

By:Drazich, Brittany F.;Gurlu, Merve;Kuzmik, Ashley;+4 moreIn:Aging & Mental Health, Jun2025, volume 29, issue 6, pages 973-979 (7p)CINAHL
Objectives: Post-discharge adverse events, such as falls, hospitalizations, and death, are more prevalent among older adults with dementia, compared to their cognitively intact counterparts. This study aimed to test the association between physical resilience and post discharge adverse events in a sample of older adults with dementia. Method: Through phone calls with caregivers over one year, we obtained data on physical resilience and post-discharge adverse events through caregiver report among a sample of 314 recently discharged older adults with dementia. We performed negative binomial regression (falls and hospitalizations) and logistic regression (death), controlling for covariates. Results: Greater physical resilience at one month post discharge was significantly associated with less falls, hospitalizations, and death within one year. Conclusion: This study highlights a particular patient profile, recently discharged older adults living with dementia who have low physical resilience, that could be targeted for intervention when discharged from the hospital.

Routine comprehensive geriatric assessment is associated with improved detection of cognitive disorders in older people with giant cell arteritis.
By:Jones, Heather;Isbel, Maxine;Harper, Kristie;+4 moreIn:Australasian Journal on Ageing, Jun2025, volume 44, issue 2, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Objectives: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) carries an increased risk of stroke and blindness. International guidelines recommend older people receive routine comprehensive geriatric assessment (RCGA) during unplanned hospital admissions to improve health outcomes. This quality improvement study addressed the need for RCGA in older people with GCA at an Australian tertiary hospital. The aims of this study were to co‐design, implement and evaluate a referral process for RCGA for hospitalised people 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of GCA and evaluate changes to the identification and management of falls and cognitive disorders (delirium, dementia and mild cognitive impairment). Methods: Hospital stakeholders co‐designed an RCGA referral pathway as a quality improvement change initiative. An observational cohort design measured implementation and outcomes. Consecutive patients aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of GCA were recruited for 15 months (n = 18), and outcomes were compared with a retrospective cohort of similar patients (n = 55). Descriptive summaries were compared between groups using non‐parametric tests. Results: Following implementation, all eligible patients received both RCGA and individualised interventions. Forty‐four per cent of patients in the RCGA group were diagnosed with delirium, dementia or mild cognitive impairment compared to 18% in the usual care group (p =.03). Conclusions: In this small population, implementation of an RCGA pathway was associated with increased detection of delirium, mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and allowed for implementation of individualised interventions.

Tools for The Rural Hand Therapy Project: A mixed methods study in a regional health service.

The Rural Hand Therapy Project: A mixed methods study in a regional health service.
By:Williams, Susan;Doherty, Gillian;Kingston, Gail;+1 moreIn:Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Jun2025, volume 72, issue 3, pages 1-16 (16p)CINAHL
Introduction: Rural occupations carry a high risk of hand injury. In rural locations, provision of hand injury rehabilitation often falls to generalist occupational therapists. However, these therapists' capacity to provide hand injury assessment and treatment is limited. The Rural Hand Therapy Project (RHTP) was developed to improve access to hand therapy for patients living in rural areas by supporting rural generalist occupational therapists to provide hand therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact, acceptability and experience of the RHTP for patients and clinicians. Methods: A convergent mixed methods design was used. Adult outpatients with a hand injury, referred by a regional hospital orthopaedic department, were reviewed pre‐intervention and post‐intervention via patient questionnaires and chart audits. The intervention was the method of hand therapy provision measured as the standard model of care (regional specialised service) and alternate model of care (RHTP). The outcome measures recorded patients' perspectives of treatment efficacy using the DASH, PSQ‐18 and the SF‐36. Semistructured interviews were conducted to evaluate the clinicians' experience of the RHTP. Consumer and Community Involvement: No consumers were involved in the study conceptualisation or analysis. Results: Sixty‐seven people were eligible and 52 people completed the study. Data were available for 33 patients treated via the standard model of care and for 19 patients treated via the RHTP. No significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to patient satisfaction, level of improvement and fidelity of service. The qualitative data obtained from interviews with eight clinicians revealed four major themes: a rural generalist that provides specialist care; increasing rural demand; flexible and proactive care; and 'if we stopped it now, we would go backward'. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the RHTP provided similar outcomes for hand therapy care for rural and remote patients when compared to their regional counterparts. Consideration of context and potential unintended impacts are important in implementation. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Hand injury treatment can be hard to access in rural areas compared to less rural areas. The Rural Hand Therapy Project was started to improve access to hand therapy treatment for people from rural areas. The program uses a few methods. These include: a regional therapist can see complex patients for their first session; better written and verbal reports about patient care; increased access for rural staff to training and advice from regional staff. The aim of the study was to look at what patients and staff from rural areas thought of the program and if the program achieved improvements. Fifty‐two people were part of this study. We measured if people living in rural areas, whose care was helped by the program, were as happy with their care as people living in a regional area. We also measured if these rural people made the same gains as those living in a regional area. We also talked to the rural staff to know what they thought of the program. The study showed that the patients from a rural area were as happy with their treatment as the regional hospital patients. Both groups got the same level of care and made the same amount of gains. Rural staff thought the program was useful. The study also showed some findings about the increased cost to rural sites to deliver hand therapy and the challenge of deciding which people should be treated first.

From June 2023 to December 2023, totally 511 hospitalized elderly patients with stroke from three tertiary grade A hospitals in Tangshan city, Hebei province were selected as the research objects by convenience sampling method. General Data Questionnaire, the Self-Awareness of Falls in Elderly Scale, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Social Support From Family Scale and Mini - Mental State Examination Scale were used to investigate. Results: The score of fall awareness in hospitalized elderly patients with stroke were (55.88±11.25). Regression analysis results showed that education level, stroke incidence times, number of complicated chronic diseases, sedentary habits, cognitive impairment, anxiety, fear of falling and family support were the influencing factors of fall awareness in hospitalized elderly patients with stroke(all P<0.05). Conclusions: The fall awareness of hospitalized elderly patients with stroke was at a high level. Nursing staff should conduct personalized health education and safety guidance based on the level of fall awareness and influencing factors to reduce the incidence of fall during hospitalization.

By:Saunders, Rosemary;Crookes, Kate;Leach, Tania;+8 moreIn:Collegian, Jun2025, volume 32, issue 3, pages 142-148 (7p)CINAHL
Hospital environments may cause or exacerbate behavioural and psychological symptoms of older adults with cognitive impairment. Many hospitals in Australia employ staff as companions to provide constant observation and additional support for those with cognitive impairment and/or at risk of falls; however, little is known about the activities of this role. To examine the activities of assistant in nursing companions allocated to older patients in hospital. A cross-sectional study design using an observation tool was conducted at an acute metropolitan hospital in Western Australia. A nonparticipant nurse conducted the observations. Descriptive statistical analysis explored the data and frequencies reported. Ninety-three observations were completed over a one-month period. Assistants in nursing companions were observed providing direct support to patients in less than half of the observations (49%), while 27% of observations recorded assistants in nursing in other activities, and 24% of observations recorded no active support. During direct support, 40% were undertaking diversionary activities. Environmental safety measures were met for most observations. Most patient surveillance forms were completed (95%); cognitive support plans were not completed for 68% of patients. Assistant in nursing companions under the direction of registered nurses can increase patient safety and provide therapeutic engagement; however, they may not be utilised to their full potential. This role is part of contemporary patient care. It is essential that training is provided to both assistants in nursing and nurses who prepare and supervise them to ensure an effective contribution to patient safety and care quality.

Tools for Multifactorial fall interventions for people over 65 years in the acute hospital setting: pre–post-test design.

Multifactorial fall interventions for people over 65 years in the acute hospital setting: pre–post-test design.
By:Wallis, Allison;Aggar, Christina;Massey, DebIn:Contemporary Nurse: A Journal for the Australian Nursing Profession, Apr-Jun2025, volume 61, issue 3, pages 257-269 (13p)CINAHL
Background: Falls are the most reported patient safety incident for patients >65 years in acute hospital settings worldwide. While multifactorial fall interventions reduce the number of falls in subacute and rehabilitation settings, fall interventions in acute hospital settings are unknown. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of multifactorial fall interventions on the number of falls using codesigned education targeting staff and the patient and review the environment in acute hospital settings in NSW, Australia for patients over 65 years of age. Method: A pre–post-test design with a non-equivalent group was conducted. All acute hospital inpatient falls occurring both pre- and post-intervention within one health district were included in this study. The use of Quality Improvement methodology identified gaps in risk screening and assessment, education and information, communication of risk, and standardised fall prevention equipment. Codesigned interventions to address these gaps were undertaken. Results: The number of falls (p = 0.038) and injurious falls (p < 0.001) significantly decreased in the post-intervention group. There was a significant improvement in fall assessments (p < 0.001), delirium risk screening (p < 0.001), the provision of fall information (p < 0.001) and fall risk discussed at shift handover (p < 0.001) in the post-intervention group. Following the intervention, staff were significantly more likely to undertake fall education modules (p < 0.001) and develop a fall management plan (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Falls continue to have a significant economic impact on the acute hospital setting. Our findings highlight multifactorial fall interventions that included staff and patients in the development phases reduced the number of falls. Multifactorial fall interventions targeting staff, patients and the environment may influence a reduction in the number of falls and the severity of falls in the acute hospital setting.

Aims: The Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) group recommends reducing fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h when blood glucose falls <14 mmol/L to reduce the risk of complications associated with acute management of diabetes‐related ketoacidosis. However, whether this change results in real‐world improvements is not known. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of DKA admissions between October 2021 and March 2023 across five hospitals in the United Kingdom. We collated data on demographics, biochemical profiles, management interventions, complications, and outcomes. Results: We identified 753 DKA admissions. There was a slow uptake of reduced‐rate FRIII, reaching 49.7% over 18 months. In DKA episodes where FRIII rate reduction guidelines were adopted, there was a significant lag (median [IQR] hours) between starting 10% Dextrose and FRIII rate reduction when blood glucose became <14 mmol/L (0.5 (0.1–1.8) vs. 3.2 (0.7–6.5), p = 0.00001). There was no significant reduction in hypoglycaemia (16.5% vs. 13.8%, p = 0.344) in episodes that adopted FRIII reduction. There were no significant differences in the frequency of hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, DKA duration, and length of stay between episodes with FRIII rate reduction versus those without FRIII. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates suboptimal adoption of guidelines. Therefore, it was perhaps unsurprising that no favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII was demonstrated. In DKA episodes where FRIII rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII when glucose levels were <14 mmol/L. Understanding the barriers and facilitators is vital in creating resources to safely implement guidelines.

Tools for A Virtual Emergency Department Reduces Unnecessary Transfers to Hospital of Residential Aged Care Residents Who Fall With Headstrike.

A Virtual Emergency Department Reduces Unnecessary Transfers to Hospital of Residential Aged Care Residents Who Fall With Headstrike.
By:Tse, Tim;Jardine, Alan George Mackenzie;Taylor, Lorcan;+6 moreIn:Emergency Medicine Australasia, Jun2025, volume 37, issue 3, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Objective: To describe the effectiveness of the Victorian Virtual Emergency Department (VVED) in reducing unnecessary transfers to hospital of patients who fall with head strike in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs). Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 and over residing in RACFs in Northern Melbourne who presented to the VVED with a fall and headstrike between May 2022 and June 2024. VVED referrals were categorised as from: (i) onscene Paramedic (VAM); (ii) nurse at RACF (VRACF); or (iii) diverted Emergency Services call (VACRA). Results: Two hundred and sixty patients (55.8% female; mean age 86 years) had a fall and headstrike. A similar number of patients were taking anticoagulant (20.8%) or antiplatelet medications (23.9%). The overall rate of transfer to hospital was 24.2% (63 of 260 patients) (VACRA 29.7%, VAM 28.2%, VRACF 18.0%). Anticoagulant use increased the likelihood of transfer (OR: 5.64, 95% CI: 2.81–9.35, p < 0.001). Chart review was performed on 42 of 63 patients transferred to hospital. CT Head was performed on 36 patients (86%) with one patient (2.8%) reported to have an intracranial haemorrhage. Eight patients (19%) were admitted with no patients requiring surgical intervention. No patients remaining at the RACF had an unexpected death related to their presentation at 7 days post‐VVED consultation. Conclusions: Prehospital consultation with a Virtual Emergency Department for RACF residents who present with a fall and head strike can lead to a reduction in ambulance transfers to a physical ED without compromising safety.

A scoping review of work patterns of junior medical officer tasks in hospital out of hours.
By:Tucker, Ben;Prowse, Catherine;Thomas, JosephineIn:Internal Medicine Journal, Jun2025, volume 55, issue 6, pages 968-974 (7p)CINAHL
Background: The role of Junior Medical Officers (JMOs) is pivotal in ensuring the delivery of patient care in hospitals. The challenges of providing medical care for patients out of hours (OOH) fall disproportionately to the JMO group, with implications for supervision and well‐being. Aim: The aim was to identify and map the available evidence on the work patterns of hospital JMOs OOH, including tools for measuring tasks and workload; barriers to JMO well‐being; factors which impact on the safety of care and strategies to reduce JMO workload OOH. Methods: A scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute framework was performed. A total of 2446 articles were identified, and 49 individual articles were included. Results: Work performed during non‐standard working hours (evenings, nights and weekends) has impacts on both patient safety (morbidity, mortality, intensive care unit readmission, procedural complications). The OOH period is associated with reduced training quality and diminished JMO well‐being. Conclusions: Strategies to reduce workload and maximise supervision are key to improving OOH care and JMO experience. A more detailed account of JMO work OOH is needed. Tools for studying workload should include direct observation.

Tools for Addressing documentation deficiencies in emergency department records: Implications for fall risk assessment and holistic care in older adults.

Addressing documentation deficiencies in emergency department records: Implications for fall risk assessment and holistic care in older adults.
By:Bergström, Sara;Rosengren, Kristina;Wallengren, Catarina;+2 moreIn:International Emergency Nursing, Jun2025, volume 80, page N.PAGCINAHL
• There are deficiencies in documenting critical patient information within ED. • Gaps in medical records hinder effective assessment of fall risk in older adults. • ED need documentation practices and assessment tools to identify at-risk patients. Falls are a substantial threat to public health globally and the leading cause of unintentional injury and death among individuals aged 65 years and older. This study aimed to review the medical records of older patients in an ED after an accidental fall to summarize their documented care process and identify factors associated with hospitalization or discharge to home. A retrospective review of medical records (n = 778) was conducted at a university hospital emergency department (ED) in Sweden. Descriptive statistics were used to report patient characteristics and differences in proportions based on information sources, the patient's inability to state the reason for the fall, and health- care interventions. The medical records documentation of all professionals focused on medical conditions but lacked information on social background, screening, and status in the ED. Being discharged after a fall accident (55%) was more common than being hospitalized (45%), and most hospitalizations were attributed to medical reasons. There were differences in documentation between hospitalized and discharged. Overall, the medical records of the hospitalized group had more information of patient's social situations and walking aids than the discharged group. The results highlight deficiencies in documenting critical patient information within ED medical records. These gaps in medical records hinder the effective assessment and management of fall risk in older adults. Therefore, implementing person-centered care (PCC) with a holistic approach along with fall prevention is essential.

Tools for The effects of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery: a retrospective cross-sectional study.

The effects of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery: a retrospective cross-sectional study.
By:Alzahrani, Khalid H;Luhaybi, Mawaddah Al;Sayeed, Abdan Bin;+3 moreIn:International Journal of Therapy & Rehabilitation, Jun2025, volume 32, issue 6, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background/Aims: Total knee replacement is a surgical procedure used to restore function and reduce pain in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis. Effective pain management can prevent complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, enables faster recovery, reduces hospital stays and improves functional outcomes. Research has found that during the 48 hours following surgery, patient-controlled epidural analgesia provided superior analgesia compared to other conventional analgesic methods. However, its impact on early rehabilitation after total knee replacement remains understudied as regards the efficacy and safety. The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to evaluate the impact of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery, while also investigating the influence of other factors that may affect early mobilisation after surgery. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to review the data of patients who received patient-controlled epidural analgesia for pain following elective unilateral total knee replacement surgery between January 2017 and August 2022, who were referred to rehabilitation in the Security Forces Hospital in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Two groups of patients were analysed, those who started mobilising on the first day and those who started mobilising on the second day following surgery. Results: A total of 186 patients were included in this study with a mean age at admission of 68.12 ± 7.59 years. Most patients (84.4%) started mobilising on the first day after surgery and (15.6%) started on the second day. When comparing mobilised patients on the first and second days, there was a statistically significant difference (P≤0.05), between the groups in terms of dizziness and hypotension. However, there were no statistically significant relationships between ambulation start and patient-controlled epidural analgesia method, dose, kind of adjunct pain medication or Bromage Score. There was no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups on the first day following surgery (P>0.05). Patients who mobilised on the first day demonstrated significantly higher levels of independence in their daily activities, as measured by the Elderly Mobility Scale and Barthel Index (P≤0.05). Conclusions: Patient-controlled epidural analgesia within a multimodal pain management plan following total knee replacement surgery does not adversely affect early rehabilitation and can contribute to the successful attainment of functional independence. Implications for practice: The use of patient-controlled epidural analgesia provides effective analgesia in the postoperative period after total knee replacement surgery and is associated with few serious complications and facilitated early rehabilitation.

Tools for Post‐Discharge COVID‐19 Symptoms Predict 1‐Year Functional Decline, Falls, and Emergency Department Visits: A Cohort Study.

Post‐Discharge COVID‐19 Symptoms Predict 1‐Year Functional Decline, Falls, and Emergency Department Visits: A Cohort Study.
By:Dias, Murilo Bacchini;Avelino‐Silva, Thiago J.;Ferriolli, Eduardo;+17 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Jun2025, volume 73, issue 6, pages 1722-1732 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Hospitalization frequently results in persistent symptoms among older adults, raising concerns about the long‐term impacts of acute events—a problem amplified by COVID‐19. We investigated the effects of persistent symptoms on functional decline and unplanned events over 1 year in older patients recovering from COVID‐19 hospitalization. Methods: This prospective cohort included patients aged ≥ 50 years who survived COVID‐19 hospitalization between March and December 2020 as part of the CO‐FRAIL study at Brazil's largest academic medical center. Persistent symptoms were defined as those reported at admission and continuously present at one‐, three‐, six‐, nine‐, and 12‐month post‐discharge, covering 16 symptoms. Outcomes included functional decline in basic activities of daily living (ADL), mobility activities, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), number of falls, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital readmissions. Associations between persistent symptoms and outcomes were examined using mixed‐effects negative binomial regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, hospitalization‐related factors, and post‐discharge rehabilitation. Results: Among 1019 patients (mean age = 65 ± 10 years; women = 45%; White = 62%), 324 (32%) experienced persistent symptoms throughout the year. Fatigue (28%), myalgia (19%), and dyspnea (13%) were the most common. Patients with ≥ 2 symptoms had an increased risk of functional decline in mobility activities (IRR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.50–2.96), IADL (IRR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.44–2.79), falls (IRR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.14–5.75), and ED visits (IRR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.27–5.70), but not readmissions. Among women, ≥ 1 persistent symptom was associated with a twofold increased risk of ADL decline. One year after discharge, patients with ≥ 2 persistent symptoms developed 1.27 more new disabilities (3.26 vs. 1.99 on a 15‐point functional scale) and had 31 more unplanned events per 100 person‐years (54.3 vs. 23.2) than those without symptoms. Conclusions: Persistent symptoms after hospitalization are common and contribute to functional decline, falls, and ED visits in older COVID‐19 survivors. These findings suggest that greater attention to symptom burden may support risk identification and improve post‐discharge care planning.

Tools for Persistently high burden of acute respiratory infections requiring hospitalization in German pediatric hospitals, fall/winter 2023–2024.

Persistently high burden of acute respiratory infections requiring hospitalization in German pediatric hospitals, fall/winter 2023–2024.
By:Dreßen, Svenja;Schneider, Josephine;Doenhardt, Maren;+17 moreIn:Infection, Apr2025, volume 53, issue 2, pages 717-725 (9p)CINAHL
Purpose: During fall 2021, children's hospitals in Germany faced a surge in RSV-related hospitalizations, whereas during fall/winter 2022–2023, RSV and influenza infections both led to increased inpatient admissions. Our study prospectively assessed severe acute respiratory infections, their causative pathogens, and the resulting disease burden on German children's hospitals for the fall/winter 2023–2024 season. Methods: From October 3, 2023 through April 16, 2024, children hospitalized with ARI as a primary diagnosis were monitored via a national survey established by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI). Weekly data was collected on total hospital admissions, ARI-related admissions by pathogen (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, influenza, other), ICU admissions with ARI as a primary diagnosis, and respiratory support. Results: Overall, 23% of German children's hospitals (77/334 centers) submitted 1234 survey reports. ARI-related hospital admissions surged starting in November 2023 and peaked in late December 2023 (53.4% of all admissions), in parallel with a peak in the average number of newly-admitted patients (aNA) with RSV (2.5 aNA). In comparison to the 2022/2023 season, fewer newborns and infants were admitted for ARI (4.7%, p < 0.001/1.9%, p = 0.05) and fewer required ICU treatment (5.3%, p = 0.02/5.6%, p = 0.001 respectively). In 74.9% of ICU patients, ventilation support was required—9.1% less than in the previous season. Conclusion: The clinical burden on pediatric hospitals and ICUs is strongly influenced by the changing, annually circulating pathogens and affected age group. Therefore, a continuous, systematic, dynamic collection of ARI data is critical for assessing the ARI-related morbidity and the associated burden on health care systems.

Purpose: Physical restraint (PR) is applied for patients' safety and to prevent the removal of inserted devices. No matter how well applied, PR causes undesired effects and discomfort to patients. Because PR‐Guidelines are not yet implemented in Turkey, an observational study was performed to get baseline data on the type and number of PR‐activities and on patients' complications in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: An observational pilot study was conducted in anesthesia and reanimation adult ICUs in a midsized general hospital in Turkey. Included were 31 patients and two data collection tools: a basic form (patient demographics, medical information, and complications) and a PR observation guide on nurses' PR‐activities. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, and mean and standard deviation) were used for data evaluation. Findings: Most patients (61.3%) were male, and 74.2% were aged 60–79 years. Almost a third was unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale <9) and at risk for falling. Of the total 33 activities of the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), 13 were never applied in 33% of patients. The most applied activity was "provide sufficient staff to assist with the safe application of physical restraining devices or manual restraints" (96.8%). Least applied were "explain inpatient and significant others the behaviors necessary for the termination of the intervention," "Provide the dependent patient with a means of summoning help" (6.5%), and "Teach family the risks and benefits of restraint reduction" (3.2%). Overall, 58.1% of patients had PR complications. Conclusions: For the first time, PR NIC activities were evaluated in a Turkish ICU. Findings show low performance of NIC activities and a high complication rate. Implications for nursing practice: The findings provide the basis to implement a PR‐Guideline in Turkish ICUs to enhance patients' safety and comfort.

Tools for Fall prevention among psychiatric patients in an Iranian hospital: a best practice implementation project.

Fall prevention among psychiatric patients in an Iranian hospital: a best practice implementation project.
By:Kabiri, Neda;Alizadeh, Mahasti;Ranjbar, Fatemeh;+6 moreIn:JBI Evidence Implementation, Apr2025, volume 23, issue 2, pages 181-189 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: Falls are the main cause of disability among psychiatric patients, as well as being the most common adverse event in hospitals. Aim: The aim of this evidence implementation project was to improve fall prevention and management among psychiatric patients in a neurology ward in an Iranian tertiary psychiatric hospital. Methods: This project used the JBI Evidence Implementation Framework, which recommends an audit, feedback, and re-audit strategy. A baseline audit was conducted to evaluate current fall prevention practices among 50 psychiatric patients and 20 health care professionals. The baseline audit was used to identify gaps in compliance. After the implementation of improvement strategies, a follow-up audit was conducted to measure any changes in practice. Results: The baseline and follow-up audits revealed that compliance with best practices improved in ward transfer fall risk assessment (Criterion 2: 87% to 90%), patient participation in fall risk assessment (Criterion 3: 95% to 96%), revising patient fall risk status (Criterion 9: 50% to 86%), and person-centered education of health care providers (Criterion 11: 78% to 96%). Other audit criteria remained unchanged. However, for Criterion 6 on patient engagement in goal-setting and treatment planning, compliance dropped from 100% at baseline to 94% at follow-up. Conclusions: This project successfully increased evidence-based practices regarding fall prevention and management, as well as providing mechanisms for sustaining the practice changes. Future audits are required to further improve outcomes. http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/IJEBH/A267

Tools for Evaluating the Relationship Between Inertia Levels and Tendency to Medical Errors Among Nurses in Paediatric Clinics.

Evaluating the Relationship Between Inertia Levels and Tendency to Medical Errors Among Nurses in Paediatric Clinics.
By:Can, Veysel;Bulduk, Mehmet;Adıyaman, AbdullahIn:Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, Apr2025, volume 31, issue 3, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the inertia levels of nurses working in paediatric clinics and their tendency to make medical errors. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted between April 2023 and June 2023 with nurses working in the paediatric clinics of a training and research hospital in a province in eastern Turkey. The Descriptive Information Form, Inertia Scale (IS) and Nursing Tendency to Medical Errors Scale (NTMSE) were used as data collection tools. The entire population was targeted without using a sampling method, and the study was completed with 221 nurses. Results: Of the nurses, 52.9% were between 26 and 33 years of age, and 52.0% were female. Additionally, 66.1% were single, 50.7% had an income less than their expenses, and 77.8% held a bachelor's degree. Inertia was significantly associated with age, marital status, income level, professional experience, duration of work and medical error training, while it was found to be lower among nurses who followed scientific publications (p < 0.05). However, there was no statistical correlation between the mean total score of the NTMSE and the descriptive characteristics (p > 0.05). An association was found between age and the falls subscale of the NTMSE, while nurses working in paediatric units exhibited higher malpractice tendencies in the falls, patient monitoring, and material safety subscales (p < 0.05). No statistically significant correlation was found between the IS and NTMSE (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The study determined that the inertia levels of nurses working in paediatric clinics were moderate and their tendency to make medical errors was low. Regular training programmes and professional development activities should be planned to reduce inertia levels and enhance professional performance. Additionally, improving the working conditions of nurses and strengthening supportive monitoring mechanisms are essential to prevent medical errors.

Spontaneous tendon rupture is a rare complication of chronic metabolic diseases. We report a rare case of a simultaneous bilateral triceps and unilateral quadriceps tendon rupture in a 22-year-old male, who is known to have chronic kidney disease and is on long-term hemodialysis. He presented to our hospital after a history of a simple fall. Our management consisted of surgical repair of all ruptured tendons in one setting. To our knowledge, no cases of bilateral triceps and unilateral quadriceps tendon rupture in the same patient have been reported in the literature thus far. Overall, spontaneous tendon rupture is a rare occurrence. In literature, management of such cases has been reported to be treated surgically. In this case report, we discuss the diagnosis and operative treatment and highlight how early surgical intervention is a key factor in the rehabilitation and functional outcome of the patient.

Background This study quantifies the impact of middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) for subdural hematomas (SDHs) by estimating a target population. Methods A population- based study at a tertiary hospital, the main SDH facility for a four- county population, used primary ICD- 10 codes over 3 years to collate SDH hospitalizations. Clinical and imaging data confirmed traumatic versus non- traumatic and acute versus non- acute (mixed or chronic) SDH. The MMAE- eligible population included patients with nontraumatic, non- acute SDH aged ≥18 years plus patients with 'traumatic' but non- acute SDH aged ≥60 years presenting with a fall. This was contrasted with the rate of large vessel strokes in the same population. Results 1279 hospitalizations with a primary ICD- 10 SDH diagnosis were identified, with 389 from the study population. Excluding repeat admissions, 350 patients were analyzed, 233 (67%) traumatic, and 117 (33%) non- traumatic SDH. Regarding etiology, 'fall ≥60 years' was the most common category in the entire cohort (n=156; 45% (95% CI 39% to 50%)). The SDH rate was 52/100 000 persons/year (95% CI 47 to 57). The rate of all non- traumatic, non- acute SDH in patients aged ≥18 years was 17/100 000 persons/year (95% CI 15 to 20), combining with 'traumatic' but non- acute fall- related SDH in patients aged ≥60 years yielded 41/100 000 persons/year (95% CI 36 to 47). This demographic may represent an MMAE- eligible population, exceeding large vessel stroke rates (31/100 000 persons/year) in the same population, estimating 139 387 potential MMAE cases/year (95% CI 121 517 to 158 168) in the USA. Conclusion MMAE could transform non- acute SDH management, especially in the elderly, potentially surpassing the impact of large vessel stroke. Clinical trials are essential for validation of its efficacy and safety compared with standard management.

Background: The Johns Hopkins Activity and Mobility Program is a systematic approach to measure and improve patient mobility. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mobility loss and quality outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used. Patients were categorized into 3 groups (gain, loss, no change in mobility) using the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scores. The association between mobility loss and falls risk, in-hospital mortality, delirium, discharge to a facility, length of stay, and 30 day readmissions were assessed. Results: Those who lost mobility were more at risk of being a high fall risk, in-hospital mortality, delirium, discharging to a facility, and had 48% longer lengths of stay. There was no association between mobility loss and 30-day readmissions. Conclusions: Loss of mobility assessed using JH-HLM scores is associated with worse patient outcomes.

Objectives: Home assessment and modification are crucial to prevent fall and fall-related injuries, especially in vulnerable subjects. This study assessed the need for home modifications and investigated risk factors associated with home injuries in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. Methods: This study was conducted at the university hospital from July 2022 to July 2023. The patients who had undergone TKA without perioperative complications were recruited. The demographics, clinical data, home environmental factors, needs for home modification, and factors related to home unintentional injury were collected at 2 weeks postoperatively. The analysis was done by using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression. Results: A total of 140 patients were included. The occurrence of falls within 2 weeks after TKA was 33.57%. The location of falls was the home entrance (29.09%), living room (23.64%), and bathroom (18.18%). About 38.5% of the patients explicitly needed home modifications. Falls were associated with inefficient grab bars [adjusted odds ratio=3.26, 95% CI=1.37-7.81, P =0.008] and lighting (adjusted odds ratio=12.83, 95% CI=1.36-121.34, P =0.026). Conclusions: Falls among post-TKA patients were frequently occurred. Preoperative home assessment and home modifications should be done in order to minimize risks of falls, particularly in common locations.

Tools for Decreasing Hospital-acquired Pressure Injuries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 5-step Quality Improvement Approach.

Decreasing Hospital-acquired Pressure Injuries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 5-step Quality Improvement Approach.
By:Nuseir, Deema;Sinno, Maya;Wilson, Mary-Agnes;+13 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Apr2025, volume 21, issue 3, pages 151-158 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) are common adverse events with large burdens on patients and health systems. In 2020, during the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of admitted patients with HAPIs of stage II and above in our health system rose from 2.92% to 3.80%. In response to rising HAPI rates across our own hospital system, we established a quality aim to reduce HAPIs stage II and above by 50% over 3 years from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We designed a multidisciplinary quality improvement HAPI prevention program. Our initiative had 5 key aspects: fostering governance and accountability, providing education and training, changing clinical practice, monitoring data and evaluation, and modernizing environments and equipment. Results: HAPI rate (outcome measure) declined from 3.8% at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 1.6% (58% reduction, P <0.00001) postintervention. Braden Risk Assessment Tool use (process measure) improved from 88.2% to 92.2%. (P =0.00024). Rate of patient falls with injuries (balancing measure) decreased from 1.5 per 1000 patient days to 1.0 per 1000 patient days (P =0.0009). Conclusions: Despite working during the COVID-19 pandemic where organizational resources were constrained and infection control practices were heightened, a multidisciplinary QI HAPI prevention program, informed by evidence-based practices and supported by access to real-time data, led to an ∼58% reduction in the HAPI rate.

Tools for Developing a systematic fall risk assessment tool for outpatient clinics.

Developing a systematic fall risk assessment tool for outpatient clinics.
By:Drees, Allison;Heinlein, Lewis;Yang, YushiIn:Journal of Patient Safety & Risk Management, Apr2025, volume 30, issue 2, pages 85-91 (7p)CINAHL
Background: In healthcare settings, fall incidents represent a significant public health issue and often result in severe injuries, prolonged hospital admissions, and substantial healthcare costs. Despite current fall risk reduction strategies, falls continue to be among the leading causes of sentinel events. Objective: This study aims to identify fall risk factors present in an outpatient clinic work system and develop tools to support proactive risk mitigation. Research Design: We introduced a systematic fall risk assessment (SFRA) tool where front-line staff can evaluate their work systems for fall risks. The tool was developed using literature review, observations, and interviews with focus groups. The tool includes step-by-step instructions for an outpatient clinic fall risk assessment, factors to consider in various settings of patient care, and guiding principles to address fall risks in an outpatient work system. Results: This tool underwent user testing, which validated its learnability, usability, and usefulness, and was rated positively by a diverse range of clinics and roles. Our preliminary results suggested that the tool was effective in identifying potential fall risk factors of outpatient clinics, even when used by non-experts. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effective use of human factors methods to equip front-line staff with tools to proactively evaluate outpatient clinic work systems for fall risks and develop mitigation strategies.

Tools for A scoping review of hospital‐based geriatric‐centered interventions on trauma surgery services.

A scoping review of hospital‐based geriatric‐centered interventions on trauma surgery services.
By:Dhanani, Hiba;Tabata‐Kelly, Masami;Jarman, Molly;+1 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Apr2025, volume 73, issue 4, pages 1250-1266 (17p)CINAHL
Background: Millions of older adults (≥65) present to emergency departments for injury annually. As the population increases, so will the number of older adults admitted for trauma. Although treatment guidelines for older adults who sustain trauma exist, the evidence for quality improvement is limited. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify hospital‐based geriatric‐centered interventions that improve care for older adults admitted to trauma services. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to identify studies related to geriatric‐centered interventions on trauma surgery services (1993–2023). Five reviewers screened studies for full‐text review based on these inclusion criteria: (1) older injured adults and/or their caregivers; (2) hospital‐based clinical interventions directed to geriatric trauma patients (e.g., frailty assessments, geriatric co‐management, triage criteria); and (3) measuring outcomes associated with geriatric trauma. We used the Donabedian quality improvement framework to categorize interventions as structures or processes. Results: Of 2243 abstracts, 66 studies met the criteria for full‐text review, and 47 were included in the analysis. Most (64%) were single‐site retrospective cohort studies at Level 1 trauma centers. The most frequent interventions (not mutually exclusive) included geriatric‐centered teams (26%), geriatric consultation (23%), interdisciplinary rounds (17%), and medication review (11%). The most frequently measured clinical outcomes were length of stay (47%), discharge location (26%), and in‐hospital mortality (21%). Two studies (4%) measured outcomes beyond 3 months. Patient‐reported outcomes were rarely included (4%), and caregiver‐specific outcomes were not measured. Conclusions: This scoping review demonstrates the variability in the types of geriatric‐centered interventions on trauma surgery services and their associated outcome measures. Furthermore, this review highlights evidence gaps in existing long‐term, post‐discharge outcomes and patient‐/caregiver‐reported outcomes. Given the increasing demand for high‐quality geriatric trauma care, our findings emphasize the need for evidence‐based national standards for geriatric trauma care and targeted study of outcomes germane to older adults and their caregivers.

Tools for A Non-Inferiority Mixed-Methods Pilot Study Examining the Impact of a Novel Nursing Care Delivery Model on Quality Hospital Metrics, Nurse Sensitive Indicators, Healthcare Professional Perspectives, and Nursing Workload.

A Non-Inferiority Mixed-Methods Pilot Study Examining the Impact of a Novel Nursing Care Delivery Model on Quality Hospital Metrics, Nurse Sensitive Indicators, Healthcare Professional Perspectives, and Nursing Workload.
By:Calabro, Emily;Pop, Rodica;Alderson, Linda;+6 moreIn:Nursing Administration Quarterly, Apr-Jun2025, volume 49, issue 2, pages 94-103 (10p)CINAHL
A global nursing shortage necessitates innovative care models to mitigate burnout, turnover, and supply-demand mismatches. This mixed-methods pilot study assessed the impact of a technology-integrated nursing care model on workload and patient outcomes in a surgical-orthopedic unit. Following IRB approval and training, the integrated care model was piloted for 6 months. The model included integration of virtual nurses, LPNs, and delivery robots. Workload perception, quality and safety, and nurse satisfaction were monitored using a time-series design. Data analysis employed correlated t-tests, comparison of means over time, and statistical process control charts (Shewhart charts). The integrated care model yielded mixed results. Hospital Acquired Conditions remained stable, while average length of stay and falls decreased. The robots have made 615 deliveries and saved staff 377 640 stjpg and 415.8 hours. After an initial low utilization, virtual nurses completed 82% admissions and discharges by the end of the pilot. However, RNs reported increased workload, staffing concerns, and teamwork challenges. This integrated care model shows promise, but further research is needed to fully assess its impact. The findings underscore the importance of continued exploration and refinement of novel approaches to address the challenges facing the nursing profession.

Tools for Comparative Analysis of Two Fall Risk Assessment Tools in the Obstetric Population.

Comparative Analysis of Two Fall Risk Assessment Tools in the Obstetric Population.
By:Weigand, Anna;Kathman, Julie;Colton, Janet;+1 moreIn:Nursing for Women's Health, Apr2025, volume 29, issue 2, pages 83-90 (8p)CINAHL
To examine the relative accuracy of the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) and the Obstetric Fall Risk Assessment System (OFRAS) in predicting obstetric patients' fall risk. Retrospective comparative analysis of the MFS and the OFRAS in obstetric inpatients. A 575-bed urban teaching hospital in Hawaii. Eighty-five records of people hospitalized for childbirth. Adequate power modeling and statistical analyses were completed using the programs R packages Version 4.0.1 and SAS Version 9.4. Subsequently, a ratio of 17 fall records to 68 nonfall records (1:4) with similar dates of admission were reviewed. Investigators collected the MFS score/risk level as documented and the required data points to obtain the OFRAS fall risk score/level. Logistic regression models were fit using the MFS and OFRAS as predictors of falls. Results are expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p values to test for statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were derived from logistic regression results and graphed to compare the instruments. Areas under ROC curve (AUROCs) were calculated to display the specificity and sensitivity of the risk assessment tools. Data for 85 pregnant or postpartum people were included in the sample. Analysis of AUROCs demonstrated that the OFRAS is more sensitive and specific for obstetric patients than the MFS. The OFRAS showed significance (p <.001) in predicting falls compared to the MFS (p =.40). Associations between fall scores and falls were examined in separate conditional logistic regression models. The OFRAS demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in fall risk prediction. The MFS performed similarly to random chance regarding obstetric fall risk prediction. The potential exists to better anticipate patient falls, protect staff from injury related to patient fall, and decrease organizational risk using a population-specific tool. In the study population, the Obstetric Fall Risk Assessment System was more sensitive than the Morse Fall Scale in predicting fall risk.

Tools for A Home‐Based Behaviour Change Intervention With Sedentary Behaviour and Physical Activity in People With Stroke and Diabetes—A Feasibility and Safety Study.

A Home‐Based Behaviour Change Intervention With Sedentary Behaviour and Physical Activity in People With Stroke and Diabetes—A Feasibility and Safety Study.
By:Ndene‐Bodilsen, Stefan Sjørslev;Aadahl, Mette;Thomsen, Trine Hørmann;+1 moreIn:Physiotherapy Research International, Apr2025, volume 30, issue 2, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background and Purpose: Stroke survivors with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) face heightened cardiovascular risks, which are exacerbated by sedentary behaviour (SB). Despite existing interventions, there remains a gap in the literature regarding effective strategies to reduce SB and increase physical activity (PA). The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and safety of the 12‐week 'Everyday Life is Rehabilitation' (ELiR) intervention comprising recruitment, adherence, practicality, and implementation into everyday life. Methods: Single‐group longitudinal intervention study with 1‐week baseline, motivational interviews at weeks 1 and 6, and 12‐week follow‐up. Stroke survivors with DM (N = 14) were recruited from Neurovascular Center at Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde. The ELiR intervention is a theory‐based intervention that focuses on healthcare professionals (HCP) consultations with stroke survivors with DM to address SB and PA. Primary outcomes were recruitment, adherence, completion of physical tests (accelerometer measurements), cognitive tests, and safety. Secondary outcomes were sedentary time and steps collected using an accelerometer and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. Results: 23 participants were recruited, of whom two were readmitted, one withdrew consent before the baseline test, and six were not discharged with a physiotherapy rehabilitation plan within 1–7 hospitalisation days. The remaining 14 were included and completed the study with a median modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 1. The ELiR intervention revealed high adherence. Three participants experienced falls, and two were hospitalised. These incidents were not related to the intervention. Future adjustments include modified inclusion criteria, SMS‐reminders, and point‐of‐care HbA1c measurements. Discussion: The ELiR intervention was feasible and safe. Falls and serious adverse events are in line with previously reported risks. Self‐reported questionnaires and clinical tests had low and moderate adherence, whereas accelerometers had high adherence. However, the small sample size limits generalisability, and adjustments to the ELiR intervention are suggested to improve usability in physiotherapy practice before testing in RCT studies to confirm these findings.

Tools for Physiotherapists' Practices on Assessing Hospitalised Older Patients: What Are the Current Gaps?

Physiotherapists' Practices on Assessing Hospitalised Older Patients: What Are the Current Gaps?
By:Ramos Hernandes, Elisângela Cristina;Maria de Moura, Geovanna;Lunardi, Adriana;+2 moreIn:Physiotherapy Research International, Apr2025, volume 30, issue 2, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Background and Purpose: Incorporating Person‐centred Care (PCC) and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) practices for hospitalised patients result in positive health outcomes. We aimed to identify the frequency of incorporating PCC and CGA practices among physiotherapists (PTs) working in hospitals and its association with PTs' gender, years of experience, and duration of physiotherapy sessions and to identify the barriers to assessing older patients in the hospital. Methods: Cross‐sectional survey with physiotherapists working in hospitals using a questionnaire including PTs characteristics, barriers and the frequency of incorporation of PCC and CGA practices, using a Likert scale. An ordinal regression analysis was conducted. Results: Male PTs, compared to females, were less likely to consider the patient's and family's feelings (OR = 0.35; p = < 0.001), use appropriate language (OR = 0.42; p = 0.04), embrace the patient's feelings (OR = 0.28; p = < 0.001), adapts their communication (OR = 0.33; p = 0.006) and used encouragement and negotiation strategies (OR = 0.52; p = 0.02). Less experienced PTs (< 2 years) tended not to value older patients' choices (OR = 0.08; p = 0.03), share assessments with families (OR = 0.39; p < 0.001), define a care plan (OR = 0.61; p = 0.02), and embrace the patient's feelings, compared to more experienced ones. PTs conducting quick assessments (< 10 min) were less likely to provide feedback (OR = 0.26; p = 0.006), share assessments with families (OR = 0.09; p < 0.001), define a care plan (OR = 0.22; p < 0.001), assess social conditions (OR = 0.34; p = 0.009), falls (OR = 0.06; p = 0.007), sarcopenia (OR = 0.18; p = 0.002), frailty (OR = 0.27; p = 0.006), provide prognosis (OR = 0.29; p = 0.002), consider older patients' goals (OR = 0.21; p = 0.04) and plan discharge (OR = 0.23; p < 0.001). The main barriers were related to patients' health conditions and the limitations of time and resources. Discussion: Incorporating PCC and CGA practices by PTs in the hospital seems to be linked to the characteristics of PTs and their availability of time. Educational and organizational interventions to foster PCC and CGA are needed.

Information Overload—Do We Read All the Posters Displayed Across the Walls on Hospital Wards?
By:Sahota, Amunpreet;Wijayasiri, Pramudi;Than, Htet;+2 moreIn:Quality Management in Health Care, Apr-Jun2025, volume 34, issue 2, pages 105-111 (7p)CINAHL
Background and Objectives: To establish whether posters displayed across the walls on hospital wards are read, what information is important, and how the information should be received. Methods: Sixty-eight staff and 32 patients' relatives were interviewed across 3 older people's medical wards followed by 20 follow-up secondary questionnaires postintervention. Results: Only 23% of those interviewed were able to recall any of the posters displayed, and of those, 34% did not find the information useful. Those interviewed were enthusiastic about utilizing alternative media. A quarter felt the walls across the hospitals wards should be for artwork. Among patients' relatives interviewed, common information requests were "the discharge pathway," "delirium," and "falls." Based on the initial findings, a targeted information board was installed and a mural was painted across the wall in one of the wards. Further post-intervention interviews with patients' relatives showed that the board was well received, but further unmet information needs were uncovered. Despite the new mural, 45% called for more paintings. Conclusions: Most people ignore the posters displayed across the walls of hospital wards, and unmet information needs are rife. An appetite exists for alternative media. Paintings were earnestly called for, highlighting how a comforting environment could be part of the holistic care we offer patients in hospital.

Enhancing Fall Risk Assessment: The Development of Nursing Education on the Modified Dionne's Egress Test on a Medical Geriatric Unit.
By:Holley, Jennifer;Vital, Cidalia J.;Benjamin, Ellen;+3 moreIn:Topics in Geriatric Rehabilitation, Apr-Jun2025, volume 41, issue 2, pages 128-136 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Geriatric falls are common and dangerous. Fall risk screening is one important element to a comprehensive fall reduction program. Local Problem: A geriatric inpatient unit in Massachusetts faced high fall rates. Established fall risk screening did not incorporate mobility assessment. Methods: This pre-post study explored staff experience, engagement, compliance, and scoring accuracy with implementation of the Modified Dionne's Egress Test (MDET). Data were collected using staff surveys, training rosters, practice assessments, and tracking sheets. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interventions: Staff were educated using a clinical pathway tool, in-person training, and reference materials. MDET implementation occurred over 6 months, beginning April 2023. Results: Pre-intervention, staff largely viewed the MDET favorably. Post-intervention surveys revealed declining satisfaction. Staff demonstrated low training engagement (24%), low compliance (16%), and moderate scoring accuracy (75%). Conclusion: Within geriatric units, MDET implementation faces significant challenges. More work is needed to support routine patient mobility assessment.

Tools for Traumatic isolated spinous process fractures.

Traumatic isolated spinous process fractures.
By:Altunrende, Muhittin Emre;Ekin, Elif EvrimIn:Turkish Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery / Ulusal Travma ve Acil Cerrahi Dergisi, Apr2025, volume 31, issue 4, pages 394-398 (5p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Isolated traumatic spinous process fractures account for a small proportion of diagnosed spinal fractures. Among spinal fractures, the cervical vertebra is the most common site of involvement, often referred to as a Clay-Shoveler's fracture. This study included patients with isolated spinous process fractures through radiologic examinations over the past five years. The study aimed to investigate the cause of trauma, the presence of spinal ligament injury, and the relationship between these fractures with age and sex. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans of the spine, performed for any reason over the past five years at the hospital where the study was conducted, were retrospectively reviewed and re-evaluated. Patients whose examinations were unrelated to trauma, those with imaging artifacts that interfered with evaluation, and those who had undergone spinal vertebral surgery were excluded. The etiology of fractures was classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses. Data on age, sex, cause of trauma, and spinal ligament injury were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients (36 men and eight women) were included in the study, with a mean age of 43.1 years. Among them, 25 patients were admitted due to traffic accidents and 18 due to falls. Spinous process fractures were observed in 18, 17, and three patients in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, respectively. Multiple spinous process fractures were found in 15 patients, while six patients had fractures in both the cervical and thoracic regions (Clay-Shoveler's fracture). In 12 patients, spinal MRI with Short-TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences was performed in addition to CT imaging. All patients with Clay-Shoveler's fracture fractures underwent both CT and MRI examinations. In all cases where MRI was performed, interspinous ligament damage was detected. However, no intracanal involvement or comorbid pathology was observed. CONCLUSION: Notably, multiple fractures may occur, particularly at the cervicothoracic junction. Although spinous process fractures associated with trauma are rarely isolated, they are usually managed with medical treatment. Therefore, the vertebrae below the initially detected fracture site should also be evaluated. Additionally, imaging studies such as MRI with STIR sequences should be performed to assess ligament damage and the neural canal, in addition to tests for evaluating bony structures. Keywords: Vertebrae; spinous process; fracture; trauma; multiple; Clay-Shoveler's fractures.

Tools for Experiences of Obstetrician-Gynecologists Providing Pregnancy Care After Dobbs.

Experiences of Obstetrician-Gynecologists Providing Pregnancy Care After Dobbs.
By:Cutler, Abigail S.;Hale, Corinne M.;Bennett, Eliza;+2 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 03/31/2025, volume 8, issue 3, page e252498CINAHL
This qualitative study evaluates how the legal landscape after Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization shaped Wisconsin obstetrician-gynecologists' ability to provide health care to patients facing pregnancy-related risks and complications. Key Points: Question: How did the fall of Roe v. Wade change how Wisconsin obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) cared for patients facing pregnancy-related risks and complications? Findings: In this qualitative study describing the experiences of 21 Wisconsin OB-GYNs practicing under the threat of criminalization after Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (Dobbs), participants described uncertainty and confusion for physicians, lack of clear guidance from hospitals and health systems, and worse care for pregnant patients. Meaning: These findings suggest that after Dobbs, the threat of a state abortion ban was detrimental to Wisconsin OB-GYNs' ability to provide standard of care to patients facing pregnancy complications. Importance: Following the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (Dobbs) decision in June 2022, which overturned the federal right to abortion, Wisconsin physicians faced the threat of an 1849 state law widely interpreted to criminalize provision of abortion except in life-saving emergencies. Physicians and their institutions were left to interpret whether and how they could treat and/or refer certain pregnant patients. Objective: To document how the post-Dobbs legal landscape shaped Wisconsin obstetrician-gynecologists' (OB-GYNs') ability to provide health care to patients facing pregnancy-related risks and complications, with particular attention to the mediating role of health care institutions. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, 21 OB-GYNs were recruited between June 2022 and December 2023 from rural and urban areas with varying hospital affiliations, scopes of practice, and individual demographics to participate in semistructured, remote interviews. Exposure: An 1849 abortion law that suspended abortion care in Wisconsin between June 2022 and December 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physicians' perceptions of (1) how the legal landscape shaped management of pregnancy and related complications, and (2) how institutional-level factors contributed to physicians' experiences caring for pregnant patients following Dobbs. Results: This study included 21 OB-GYNs (mean [SD] age, 43 [5.88] years; 16 [76.2%] female; 5 [23.8%] non-White and 16 [76.2%] White) who practiced obstetrics in Wisconsin. OB-GYNs described how the threat of criminalization following Dobbs was detrimental to physicians' ability to provide pregnancy care. Absence of legal clarity surrounding the 1849 law led to confusion and wide variations in institutional comfort and clinical practice, which resulted in substandard, delayed, and fragmented patient care. Overwhelmingly, the threat of criminalization after Dobbs exacerbated barriers for physicians providing comprehensive pregnancy care and patients seeking it. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study of OB-GYNs practicing in an abortion-restrictive state, threat of criminalization in post-Dobbs Wisconsin resulted in uncertainty and confusion for OB-GYNs and worse care for pregnant patients. The absence of clear guidance and support from institutional and health care system leadership emerged as a particularly salient missed opportunity. These experiences, which contribute to a critical evidence base on the harms of abortion restrictions, are relevant to states facing similar bans that criminalize or restrict health care.

Tools for Management of care for hospitalized older persons - comfort as an essential outcome: a qualitative study.

Management of care for hospitalized older persons - comfort as an essential outcome: a qualitative study.
By:Mourão Nicoli, Esther;Valéria Costa e Silva, Frances;Pereira Caldas, Célia;+3 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 03/24/2025, volume 24, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: The global aging population highlights the need for accurate care management, tailored to their specific needs. This study investigated the production of comfort as a therapeutic outcome of nursing care management for hospitalized older persons. Methods: This exploratory descriptive research was conducted in 9 medical wards and 4 surgical wards of a university hospital in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, via a qualitative approach. Between May and June, 2022, the researchs collected data from 19 nurses in management positions. Semistructured interviews were conducted, and the researchers investigated the data thus collected via thematic-categorical content analysis on the basis of the approach developed by Bardin. The theoretical framework was based on Kolcaba's Comfort Theory. Results: Inadequate staffing was the main challenge among the forces (barriers) that were observed to obstruct the care management of hospitalized older persons, what lead to task prioritization that favored techinical over comfort-focued care. Additionally, the overload and stress faced by nurses created discomfort for the team, which was reflected in the care that they provided. The results also revealed that a lack of knowledge represented a significant challenge because professional insecurity led nurses to choose restrictive interventions; however, this approach ultimately sacrified comfort. Alongside with leadership, experience emerged as a primary facilitating force. The main risks faced by hospitalized older persons that were identified by nurses included falls, pressure injuries, delirium, pneumonia, and bronchoaspiration. The main nursing interventions used to ensure comfort and safety of hospitalized older persons pertained to the environment as well as to the need to encourage the presence of family members. However, intervening variables, beyond the professional's control, such as inapproprieted hospital infrastructure and the unavailability of family members, were not considered. As a result, the interventions proved to be ineffective since they did not address these factors that impacted patient's levels of comfort. Conclusions: Analysis of the findings of this research revealed that although care management focused on promoting comfort, safety and autonomy among patients, nursing practices prioritized patient safety while sacrificing comfort and autonomy. Trial registration: This work was approved by the Ethics Committee - no. 57513722.0.0000.5282.

Objective: To investigate the statues quo of pre⁃frailty in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy, analyze its influencing factors and construct a risk prediction model. Methods: A total of 290 elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou were selected as subjects by convenience sampling from September 1, 2023 to February 18, 2024. General information questionnaire, Frailty Phenotype, The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, Barthel Index, The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, Social Support Scale, Seff ⁃ Rating Scale of Sleep, and Clock Drawing Test were used to investigate and evaluate patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors, RStudio (version 4. 1. 1) was used to construct the Nomogram risk prediction model, and the Hosmer⁃Lemeshow goodness⁃of⁃fit test and receiver operator characteristic curve were used to analysis the goodness ⁃ of ⁃ fit and prediction performance of the model. Results: Among the 290 patients, 191 patients were in the pre⁃frailty, accounting for 65. 9%. Logistic regression analysis showed that age, history of falls, stoma, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, malnutritional risk, depression status and neuropsychiatric symptoms were the influencing factors of pre-frailty in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The results of Hosmer⁃Lemeshow goodness⁃of⁃fit test showed that χ² =6. 896, P=0. 548, area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic was 0. 867(95%CI 0. 825 ⁃ 0. 909). The Youden index was the highest(0. 568), the sensitivity was 0. 780, and the specificity was 0. 788 when the critical value was 0. 633. Conclusions: The proportion of elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy in the stage of pre⁃frailty is high, and age, history of falls, stoma, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, malnutritional risk, depression status and neurosomatic symptoms are significant predictors of pre⁃frailty in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The risk prediction model based on influencing factors demonstrates good predictive accuracy and discrimination capabilities.

Falls are common events in hospitalized patients and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among older adults. Healthcare professionals can positively impact fall rates through nurse-led strategies such as an evidence-based framework addressing age-related risk factors. A quality improvement project supported by the NICHE Leadership Training Program (LTP), titled "See the E, PEEK on Me," was developed to address falls in older adults on a pilot unit at one campus of an academic health system (AHS). Results of the implementation demonstrated a reduction in falls for patients over the age of 65 over a one-year period.

Tools for Injury patterns and patient outcomes of abdominal trauma in the elderly population: a 5-year experience of a Major Trauma Centre.

Injury patterns and patient outcomes of abdominal trauma in the elderly population: a 5-year experience of a Major Trauma Centre.
By:Chatzopoulou, Despoina;Alfa-Wali, Maryam;Hewertson, Edward;+3 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, 12/03/2025, volume 51, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: The management of abdominal trauma in older patients is challenging due to preexisting comorbidities, impaired physiology, frailty and atypical clinical presentations. Few studies focus on the characteristics of abdominal trauma in older populations. Methods: A retrospective service evaluation was conducted during the period January 2017 - December 2022 at University Hospital Southampton, the designated Major Trauma Centre (MTC) of Wessex Trauma Network in the United Kingdom. Data was collected from the local Trauma Registry. Patients aged ≥ 65 years old and with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) over one for the Abdomen were included. Patients aged less than 65 years old and those who died on arrival to the MTC were excluded. Results: Out of 4977 geriatric trauma patients, only 150 cases (3%) were eligible, with a mean age of 77 years and a median Injury Severity Score of 22. The trauma team activation code was triggered in just under half of all cases (49%). All-level falls were the leading mechanism (52%) and low-energy falls were significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 85 years (P <0.001). The spleen was the most frequently affected organ (27%). About 47% of abdominal injuries were severe (AIS Abdomen ≥3) and about 22% of patients required surgical or radiological intervention. Three patients sustained occult abdominal injuries and one of them had a negative CT scan initially. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 20%. Of all casualties, most were polytrauma cases (87%). Conclusion: Despite the low incidence of abdominal injuries in the elderly, when these occurred, almost half were serious with AIS Abdomen ≥ 3 and almost one in four required surgical or radiological intervention. The use of single-time imaging may not be sufficient to ensure the absence of injury, as delayed manifestations of occult abdominopelvic trauma may occur. Close monitoring and regular reassessments are recommended, even with a negative CT scan on arrival. The high all-cause mortality rate may correlate with the high incidence of polytrauma in this cohort and the failure to trigger a trauma call in the Emergency Department. Future studies should focus on the development of triage tools and include the use of validated and designated frailty tools for larger population analysis.

Tools for Emergency Department Programs to Support Medication Safety in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Emergency Department Programs to Support Medication Safety in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
By:Skains, Rachel M.;Hayes, Jane M.;Selman, Katherine;+10 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 11/03/2025, volume 8, issue 3, page e250814CINAHL
Key Points: Question: Are geriatric medication programs based in the emergency department (ED) associated with reduced potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and adverse events for adults aged 65 years or older? Findings: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 eligible studies with 44 640 participants found that multidisciplinary approaches, including clinical pharmacists and geriatricians, were associated with improved PIM deprescribing among older adults but not with hospital outcomes, while computerized clinical decision support systems, with or without ED clinician education, were associated with enhanced geriatric ordering and prescribing practices by reducing PIMs. However, medication reviews targeting fall risk–increasing drugs were not associated with reduced falls in older adults. Meaning: These findings will inform the implementation of ED-based geriatric medication safety programs in updating the Geriatric ED Guidelines version 2.0. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates whether any emergency department–based medication programs for adults aged 65 years and older are associated with lower adverse process or clinical outcomes. Importance: Given that older adults are at high risk for adverse drug events (ADEs), many geriatric medication programs have aimed to optimize safe ordering, prescribing, and deprescribing practices. Objective: To identify emergency department (ED)–based geriatric medication programs that are associated with reductions in potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and ADEs. Data Sources: A systematic search of Scopus, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, ProQuest Central, CINAHL, AgeLine, and Cochrane Library was conducted on February 14, 2024, with no date limits applied. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials or observational studies focused on ED-based geriatric (aged ≥65 years) medication programs that provide ED clinician support to avoid PIMs and reduce ADEs. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for abstracting data and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool were used to assess data quality and validity. Abstract screening and full-text review were independently conducted by 2 reviewers, with a third reviewer acting as an adjudicator. Main Outcomes and Measures: Process (ordering, prescribing, and deprescribing PIM rates) and clinical (ADE, health care utilization, and falls) outcomes. Results: The search strategy identified 3665 unique studies, 98 were assessed for eligibility in full-text review, and 25 studies, with 44 640 participants, were included: 9 clinical pharmacist reviews (with 28 360 participants), 1 geriatrician teleconsultation (with 50 participants), 8 clinician educational interventions (with 5888 participants), 4 computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS; with 9462 participants), and 3 fall risk–increasing drug (FRID) reviews (with 880 participants). Clinical pharmacist review was not associated with decreased hospital admission or length of stay, but 2 studies showed a 32% reduction in PIMs from deprescribing (odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P =.01). One study also found that ED geriatrician teleconsultation was associated with enhanced deprescribing of PIMs. Three clinician educational intervention studies showed a 19% reduction in PIM prescribing (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.96]; P =.02). Two computerized CDSS studies showed a 40% reduction in PIM ordering (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.48-0.74]; P <.001). FRID reviews were not associated with reduced time to first fall or fall recurrence at 12 months. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of ED-based geriatric medication safety programs, a multidisciplinary team, including clinical pharmacists and/or geriatricians, was associated with improved PIM deprescribing. Furthermore, computerized CDSS, alone or in combination with ED clinician education, was associated with enhanced geriatric ordering and prescribing practices. These findings will inform the Geriatric ED Guidelines version 2.0 update.

Tools for Predictive ability of frailty scores in surgically managed patients with traumatic spinal injuries: a TQIP analysis.

Predictive ability of frailty scores in surgically managed patients with traumatic spinal injuries: a TQIP analysis.
By:Forssten, Maximilian Peter;Ekestubbe, Lovisa;Cao, Yang;+4 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, 04/03/2025, volume 51, issue 1, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Purpose: Frailty has gained recognition as a crucial determinant of patient outcomes following traumatic spinal injury (TSI), particularly due to its increasing incidence in elderly populations. The aim of the current investigation was therefore to compare the ability of several frailty scores to predict adverse outcomes in surgically managed isolated TSI patients without spinal cord injury. Methods: All adult patients (18 years or older) who suffered an isolated TSI due to blunt trauma, and required surgical management, were extracted from the 2013–2021 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. The ability of the Orthopedic Frailty Score (OFS), the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), the 11-factor (11-mFI) and 5-factor (5-mFI) modified frailty index, as well as the Johns Hopkins Frailty Indicator to predict adverse outcomes was compared based on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Subgroup analyses were also performed on patients who were ≥ 65 years old and those who were injured due to a ground-level fall (GLF). Results: A total of 39,449 patients were selected from the TQIP database. The 5-mFI and 11-mFI outperformed all other frailty scores when predicting in-hospital mortality (5-mFI AUC: 0.73) (11-mFI AUC: 0.73), any complication (5-mFI AUC: 0.65) (11-mFI AUC: 0.65), and FTR (5-mFI AUC: 0.75) (11-mFI AUC: 0.75). Among the 14,257 geriatric patients, however, the OFS demonstrated the highest predictive ability for in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0.65). The OFS (AUC: 0.64) also performed on the same level as both the 5-mFI (AUC: 0.63) and the 11-mFI (AUC: 0.63) when predicting FTR in this population. Among the 9616 patients who were injured due to a GLF, the OFS performed on par with the 5-mFI and 11-mFI when predicting in-hospital mortality and FTR. Conclusion: Simpler scores like the 5-factor modified Frailty Index and Orthopedic Frailty Score outperform or perform on par with more complicated frailty scores when predicting mortality, complications, and failure-to-rescue in surgically managed isolated traumatic spinal injury patients without spinal cord injury, particularly among geriatric patients and those injured in a GLF.

Tools for Risk screening by the emergency medical services identifies older patients at risk of emergency department readmission: a retrospective observational study.

Risk screening by the emergency medical services identifies older patients at risk of emergency department readmission: a retrospective observational study.
By:Saario, Eeva;Mäkinen, Marja;Castrén, Maaret;+1 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, 01/03/2025, volume 37, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Malnutrition, falls, and cognitive impairment are common in older patients visiting the emergency department (ED). Early recognition of these conditions could trigger interventions to improve outcomes following ED visits. Aim: To analyze whether a simple risk screening protocol in the emergency medical services (EMS) identifies older patients at risk of ED readmission. Methods: The EMS screened the falls risk, nutritional risk, and cognition of 472 patients (age ≥ 70 years) transported to the ED of a Finnish secondary care hospital between November 2018 and July 2019. Data on the risk screening, comorbidities, and ED readmissions were collected from electronic patient records. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression, and the results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Results: Altogether 312 patients (66%) experienced 880 ED readmissions during the 12-month follow-up. Nutritional risk was associated with an increased ED readmission rate across all time categories (< 1, 1–3, 3–6, and ≥ 6 months; IRRs 1.36–1.62, p-values < 0.05). Falls risk was associated with ED readmissions from one month after the index ED visit (IRRs 1.41–1.57, p-values < 0.05). Impaired cognition had no effect on readmissions (IRRs 1.14–1.26, p-values > 0.1). Conclusions: Patients with nutritional risk or falls risk, identified by the EMS, had a higher ED readmission rate independent of comorbidity. EMS risk screening could supplement the assessment in the ED to better identify older patients who might benefit from more detailed assessment of their health status and interventions to prevent ED readmission.

Background: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of traumatic injuries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, data of trauma patients admitted to the six hospitals affiliated with the National Trauma Registry of Iran (NTRI) before (from April 21, 2017, to February 19, 2020) and during (from February 20, 2020, to November 30, 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic were used. The data were collected by interviewing and patients' documents, including demographic data, cause of injury, in-hospital mortality, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Results: Seventeen thousand four traumatic patients were included in the registry. The mean of monthly admitted patients declined from 360 patients before the COVID-19 pandemic to 213 patients during the pandemic. The percentage of conflict/interpersonal violence and self-harm/suicide among all registered traumas increased from 2.9% and 0.8% before the CO VID-19 pandemic to 5.3% and 2.4 during the CO VID-19 pandemic, respectively (Ps<0.001). Additionally, the percentage of registered patients with fall injuries before the COVID-19 pandemic was 27.5% and reached 24.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, before the pandemic, ICU admissions and inhospital mortality were 9.8% and 1.1%, respectively, and reached 12.7% and 1.8% during the pandemic (Ps <0.001). Furthermore, the HFOS decreased from 148.5 (SD=570.7) hours to 117.4 (SD=226.6) hours (p<0.001). Conclusion: The findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic led to several significant changes in the patterns of trauma patients admitted to the NTRI centers, including gender, age, and cause of trauma and it increased the ICU admissions and in-hospital mortalities and reduced HFOS.

The inter-rater reliability of emergency department and paramedic frailty screening in older patients following a fall.
By:Indrawan, Nikita;Ellis, Jason;Finn, Judith;+1 moreIn:Australasian Emergency Care, Mar2025, volume 28, issue 1, pages 63-66 (4p)CINAHL
Screening for frailty in the emergency setting may be useful in directing patients to appropriate management pathways. The main aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater reliability of the Clinical Frailty Scale between paramedics and emergency department staff (doctors and allied heath) for patients after a fall. Secondarily, to assess how these scores correlate with patient outcomes. A prospective study of older patients arriving by ambulance to a single hospital in Western Australia following a fall. The inter-rater reliability was assessed using a weighted Cohen's κ. The relationship between Clinical Frailty Scale and secondary outcomes were assessed using chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Data from 94 patients were included, the mean age was 82 years and 64 % were female. The inter-rater reliability between paramedics and emergency department staff using the Clinical Frailty Scale was moderate (κ 0.48 (95 % CI 0.36–0.59)). There is only moderate agreement between emergency department staff and paramedics when screening for frailty in patients who present after a fall. The findings indicate the need to improve reliability as a pre-requisite to the use of frailty screening in emergency settings.

Epidemiological Profile of the Victims Involved in Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) and ICD-10 Classification Attending an Emergency Department: A Descriptive Study.
By:Darivemula, Surendra Babu;Jabeen, Sayeda Misbah;Surapaneni, Sai Revanth A.;+6 moreIn:Indian Journal of Community Medicine, Mar/Apr2025, volume 50, issue 2, pages 356-360 (5p)CINAHL
Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years. They cause approximately 1.3 million deaths every year, with 20 to 50 million more people suffering nonfatal injuries and many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. A retrospective record-based descriptive study was performed to analyze the epidemiological profile of the patients attending with road traffic accidents (RTA) to emergency/casualty department in a tertiary care hospital. The purposive sample from the last 7 months with those affected from RTA cases came to casualty and undergone treatment during the study duration and the exclusion criteria were brought dead patients. Out of 397 victims, 309 (77.8%) were male and 88 (22.2%) were female and mean age with SD 37.19 ± 13.9 years. Majority 143 (36.0%) had self-fall, 64 (16.1%) 2-wheeler vs pedestrian, 63 (15.9%) 2-wheelers vs 4-wheeler, 55 (13.9%) under 2-wheelers vs 2-wheeler. Majority were happened on Saturday 60 (15.1%), Sundays 71 (17.9%) and the rest on an average of 50 incidents in a day; out of them, the incident happened at evening 98 (24.7%) night 136 (34.2%) morning 109 (27.5%), and in the afternoon time 54 (13.6%), respectively. Accidents have male predominance, with more victims from adults and middle age 21-40 years. Most common category of the victim was motorcycle rider, followed by pedestrians, and as per ICD-10 classification, the common mechanism of incident happened was motorcycle rider noncollision transport accident (Code: V28).

Tools for Epidemiology and Prognostic Factors Analysis of Electrical Injuries in Shaanxi, China: A Single-Center Observational Study of 385 Cases.

Epidemiology and Prognostic Factors Analysis of Electrical Injuries in Shaanxi, China: A Single-Center Observational Study of 385 Cases.
By:Zhao, Huaqiang;Lei, Zhanjun;Yang, Ming;+5 moreIn:Journal of Burn Care & Research, Mar/Apr2025, volume 46, issue 2, pages 285-293 (9p)CINAHL
The objective of this research is to investigate the epidemiological features of electrical injuries in Shaanxi Province, China, examine their prognosis, and ascertain the factors that impact the outcomes. Telephone follow-ups were conducted with patients with electrical injuries at our hospital between 2011 and 2021, yielding the following results: Most electrical injuries occur in males (94.3%) and younger or middle-aged individuals. The most common voltages involved are 220 and 380 V. Since 2016, there has been a 20.1% annual decrease in electrical injuries, with most cases occurring from April to September. Patients typically undergo 1 surgical procedure (0.3), with a 14.8% amputation rate and an average hospital stay of 21 days (9.43). A total of 1.8% of patients with electrical injuries have died, 17.1% have permanent nerve damage, and 10.8% need help with daily tasks; 18.5% have psychological issues, and 9.6% have posttraumatic stress disorder; and 93.7% return-to-work in an average of 6 months (2.12). Amputation risk is influenced by voltage, muscle injury, and current pathway; skin grafting risk is mainly due to voltage. Heart injuries are affected by unconsciousness and current pathways; labor loss risk factors include voltage, falls from heights, and muscle injury; and nerve damage is linked to muscle injury. Cataract development risk is associated with electric shock to the head and neck. It is crucial to address the psychological well-being of patients and provide necessary support. Patient input should be taken into account when deciding on treatment for nonfunctional limbs. Physicians should evaluate prognostic factors and provide appropriate treatment to enhance patient outcomes.

A systematic review of reasons and risks for acute service use by older adult residents of long‐term care.
By:Merrick, Eamon;Bloomfield, Katherine;Seplaki, Christopher;+8 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Mar2025, volume 34, issue 3, pages 697-714 (18p)CINAHL
Aims and Objectives: To identify the reasons and/or risk factors for hospital admission and/or emergency department attendance for older (≥60 years) residents of long‐term care facilities. Background: Older adults' use of acute services is associated with significant financial and social costs. A global understanding of the reasons for the use of acute services may allow for early identification and intervention, avoid clinical deterioration, reduce the demand for health services and improve quality of life. Design: Systematic review registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022326964) and reported following PRISMA guidelines. Methods: The search strategy was developed in consultation with an academic librarian. The strategy used MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Articles published since 2017 in English were eligible for inclusion. CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection were searched (11/08/22). Title, abstract, and full texts were screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction was performed two blinded reviewers. Quality of evidence was assessed using the NewCastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Thirty‐nine articles were eligible and included in this review; included research was assessed as high‐quality with a low risk of bias. Hospital admission was reported as most likely to occur during the first year of residence in long‐term care. Respiratory and cardiovascular diagnoses were frequently associated with acute services use. Frailty, hypotensive medications, falls and inadequate nutrition were associated with unplanned service use. Conclusions: Modifiable risks have been identified that may act as a trigger for assessment and be amenable to early intervention. Coordinated intervention may have significant individual, social and economic benefits. Relevance to clinical practice: This review has identified several modifiable reasons for acute service use by older adults. Early and coordinated intervention may reduce the risk of hospital admission and/or emergency department. Reporting method: This systematic review was conducted and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Patient or public contribution: No patient or public contribution.

Background: Nurses routinely perform multiple risk assessments related to patient mobility in the hospital. Use of a single mobility assessment for multiple risk assessment tools could improve clinical documentation efficiency, accuracy and lay the groundwork for automated risk evaluation tools. Purpose: We tested how accurately Activity Measure for Post‐Acute Care (AM‐PAC) mobility scores predicted the mobility components of various fall and pressure injury risk assessment tools. Method: AM‐PAC scores along with mobility and physical activity components on risk assessments (Braden Scale, Get Up and Go used within the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model®, Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) and Morse Fall Scale) were collected on a cohort of hospitalised patients. We predicted scores of risk assessments based on AM‐PAC scores by fitting of ordinal logistic regressions between AM‐PAC scores and risk assessments. STROBE checklist was used to report the present study. Findings: AM‐PAC scores predicted the observed mobility components of Braden, Get Up and Go and JHFRAT with high accuracy (≥85%), but with lower accuracy for the Morse Fall Scale (40%). Discussion: These findings suggest that a single mobility assessment has the potential to be a good solution for the mobility components of several fall and pressure injury risk assessments.

Tools for Enhancing Accurate Delirium Detection in Older Patients With Heart Failure: Integrating Education and an Electronic Health Record Tool for Nurses.

Enhancing Accurate Delirium Detection in Older Patients With Heart Failure: Integrating Education and an Electronic Health Record Tool for Nurses.
By:Tabarani, Eva;Hickey, Kimberly;Blush III, Raymond R.In:Journal of Doctoral Nursing Practice, 2025, volume 18, issue 1, pages 68-87 (20p)CINAHL
Background: Detecting delirium accurately in older patients with heart failure (HF) is challenging for nurses due to difficulties in assessing baseline cognition, leading to inaccurate delirium assessment. Objective: The project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention and a documentation tool in the electronic health record (EHR) to enhance delirium detection rates by up to 30% in patients over 65 years with HF. Methods: Delirium detection rates were assessed pre- and postimplementation through chart review spanning 8 weeks. The Chart-based Delirium Identification Instrument was applied to preimplementation (2023) and postimplementation (2024) data for comparison over 8 weeks. Additionally, the project included a pre–post survey to examine nurses' self-reported knowledge, confidence, and perspectives on delirium detection and management. Results: Nurses achieved a 100% detection rate by accurately identifying the sole case of delirium postimplementation. Notably, nurses accurately ruled out delirium in patients who tested negative. Additionally, they reported increased knowledge and confidence in delirium detection. Conclusions: The dual intervention of nurses' education and structural documentation support contributed to enhancing the nurses' ability to accurately identify delirium. The intervention facilitated the consistent identification and documentation of baseline cognition. The streamlined process ensured consistency and facilitated easy retrieval by nurses when completing the Confusion Assessment Method for delirium detection. Implications for Nursing: Combining nurse education and an EHR tool ensures equitable access to resources for accurate delirium detection among older patients with HF. Improving delirium detection rates helps provide targeted interventions, ultimately reducing disparities in delirium-related outcomes.

Tools for The Implementation of Perioperative Geriatric Management Could Decrease the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly Undergoing Major Orthopedic Surgeries.

The Implementation of Perioperative Geriatric Management Could Decrease the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly Undergoing Major Orthopedic Surgeries.
By:Zou, Yan;Deng, Tingzhi;Xu, Yu;+5 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Mar2025, volume 21, issue 2, pages 95-100 (6p)CINAHL
Objectives: This study aimed to explore the association of perioperative geriatric management (PGM) in major orthopedic surgeries. Methods: One hundred seventy-five participants aged 75 and older were in-hospital patients who underwent major orthopedic surgery from September 2020 to September 2021, and they received PGM and necessary treatment for indicators with abnormal value (the PGM group). Another 175 participants in the control group only received the evaluation part of the PGM, recruited by filtering in the electronic medical record system from March 2016 to March 2017. The treatment included joint intervention of psychiatrists and rehabilitation physicians. For example, for patients at risk for falling, evaluation of inadequate blood volume, delirium, abnormal gait, and visual impairment should be performed. The logistic regression analysis was adopted to determine the association of PGM and postoperative delirium. Results: The prevalence of postoperative delirium among participants was 13.71%. Compared with the empirical treatment group, the postoperative delirium was significantly decreased (7.43% versus 14.29%) (P <0.05). Compared with the control group, participants were in the PGM group were at lower risk of postoperative delirium, mainly attributed to these following factors: Charlson comorbidity index <5 [odds ratio (OR)=0.620; 95% CI: 0.010-0.623], mini cog >2 (OR=0.224; 95% CI: 0.061-0.824), Confusion Assessment Method score indicating low risk (OR=0.079; 95% CI: 0.010-0.623), nutritional risk screening scale <3 (OR=0.306; 95% CI: 0.095-0.989), and major adverse cardiovascular events <3 (OR=0.253; 95% CI: 0.073-0.720). After adjusting for the length of hospital stay and reason for hospitalization, the association between the parameters above and postoperative delirium is still significant (P <0.05). Conclusions: The implementation of the PGM could decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium significantly, which might contribute to improving the overall prognosis in elderly patients who underwent major orthopedic surgeries.

Tools for Incidence and severity of community acquired pneumonias in children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Incidence and severity of community acquired pneumonias in children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
By:Koliou, Maria G;Aristidou, Athina;Mazeri, Stella;+5 moreIn:Journal of Public Health, Mar2025, volume 47, issue 1, pages 9-14 (6p)CINAHL
Background During the first year of the covid-19 pandemic the adoption of non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), resulted in a significant fall in the incidence of respiratory tract infections. However, after the relaxation of these restrictions some of these infections have returned. This study evaluates the incidence and severity of community acquired pneumonias (CAPs) in children before and after the onset of pandemic. Methods Characteristics of CAPs admitted to Archbishop Makarios Hospital, between March 2016 and February 2023 were reviewed. Comparison was made between the first, second and third pandemic year, and the four pre-pandemic years. Results The mean annual number of admissions in the pre-pandemic years was 32 and dropped to 11 during the first pandemic year. However, admissions increased again in the second year of the pandemic to 41 (increase by 28%), and this increase was sustained into the third year. The proportion of complicated pneumonias, approximately doubled, from 20% in the pre-pandemic years to 35% and 33% in the second and third pandemic year, respectively. Conclusions During the first year the use of NPIs appeared to have decreased the incidence of pneumonias. However, during the second and third pandemic years, an increase in the numbers and severity of pneumonias was noted.

Tools for Understanding the Personalities of Patients Who Sustained Minor Injuries Attending the Emergency Department in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.

Understanding the Personalities of Patients Who Sustained Minor Injuries Attending the Emergency Department in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.
By:Bing Chan SHU;RAHMAN, Nik Hisamuddin NIK ABDUL;DINSUHAIMI, Syaheedatul ImanIn:Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences, 2025, volume 32, issue 2, pages 77-86 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Injuries from road traffic accidents, falls, and other causes are a global health burden. In Malaysia, while mechanical and geographical factors in injuries are well studied, the role of psychosocial aspects, such as personality traits, remains underexplored. This study investigates the influence of personality traits, measured by the Universiti Sains Malaysia Personality Inventory (USMaP-i), on minor injury occurrence among patients at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, focusing on extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 150 adult patients, comparing those with minor injuries to a control group without injuries. The Big Five personality traits were assessed using the USMaP-i, and associations with injury risk were analysed using independent t-tests, Pearson's chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression (MLR). Results: Significant associations were identified between specific personality traits and injury risk. Higher levels of extraversion were correlated with an increased injury risk, whereas openness demonstrated a protective effect. Gender also played a role, with males showing a 2.8- fold higher likelihood of injury than females. Other traits, such as neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, were not significantly associated with injury occurrence. Conclusion: Extraversion and openness significantly influenced the injury risk. The findings of this study enable the development of evidence-based prevention strategies through i) personality-based screening in the emergency department to identify high-risk individuals, particularly those with elevated extraversion scores; ii) targeted safety education programmes addressing trait-specific risk behaviours; and iii) gender-specific interventions focusing on male risk-taking tendencies. These tailored approaches can enhance existing injury prevention frameworks by incorporating psychological and behavioural factors alongside traditional safety measures.

Tools for Skin tears in older patients in intensive care units: A multicentre point prevalence study.

Skin tears in older patients in intensive care units: A multicentre point prevalence study.
By:Yuceler Kacmaz, Hatice;Kahraman, Hilal;Topal Hancer, Ayşe;+6 moreIn:Nursing in Critical Care, Mar2025, volume 30, issue 2, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: With the ageing of the global population, it is predicted that the population of older adult patients in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) will increase. Because of health conditions, care practices and ageing‐related skin changes, older adult ICU patients are prone to skin integrity problems, including skin tears (STs). Aim: To determine the prevalence of STs and associated factors in older patients hospitalized in ICUs. Study Design: The study is a regional, multicentre, point prevalence study conducted in five centres in the five largest cities in terms of population in the Central Anatolia Region of Türkiye. Data were collected simultaneously in each centre on the same day. The list of patients hospitalized in the ICUs on the day of data collection was drawn up, and 200 patients who were 65 years of age or older, were hospitalized in ICUs and agreed to participate in the research were included. The researchers formed an "ST chart" to record patient demographic characteristics, clinical variables and skin assessment. Results: STs were detected in 14.5% of patients in ICUs, with 72.5% of them having stage 1 ST. A significant relationship was found between individuals' average body mass index (BMI) (p =.043), age (p =.014), length of stay in the ICU (p =.004) and having ST. There was also a statistically significant relationship between skin temperature (p =.002), skin turgor (p =.001) and ST. More STs were observed in patients with cold skin and low turgor. The prevalence of ST was higher in individuals with a history of ST. Additionally, there was a statistically significant relationship between consciousness (p =.014), incontinence (p =.006), the Braden score (p =.004), the Itaki fall risk score (p =.006) and ST. Conclusions: In this multicentre point prevalence study, the prevalence of ST in older patients in ICUs was 14.5%, and many factors associated with ST have been identified. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Given the insufficient information and attention to STs in older adults, the study emphasizes the importance of addressing STs. The impact of STs includes increased treatment costs, length of stay and risk of complications. Therefore, understanding the global extent of STs in ICUs and developing effective interventions for prevention and management are crucial.

Tools for The identification and characterization of nurse-sensitive outcomes in acute and critical care: A systematic review.

The identification and characterization of nurse-sensitive outcomes in acute and critical care: A systematic review.
By:McEvoy, Natalie L.;Kalvas, Laura Beth;Walsh, Killian;+1 moreIn:Nursing Outlook, Mar2025, volume 73, issue 2, page N.PAGCINAHL
Few nurse-sensitive patient and family outcome measures are included in hospital core metrics used for accreditation, credentialing, or recognition. Identify and characterize patient and family outcome measures that are sensitive to the work of acute and critical nursing. Systematic literature review that included all age groups and excluded measures commonly reported for hospital accreditation, credentialing, or recognition (i.e., patient falls, pressure injuries/pressure ulcers, and hospital-acquired infections). In total, 16 studies met review criteria. Eight (50%) studies were conducted in acute care, five (31.3%) in critical care, and three (18.8%) in surgical settings. Eight (50%) were conducted in adults, four (25%) in pediatrics, and one (6.3%) in neonates. Three (18.8%) studies did not specify the population of interest. Overall, 55 nurse-sensitive outcomes were identified and 47 (85.5%) were operationally defined. These included patient/family satisfaction (n = 7, 12.7%), patient complications (n = 6, 10.9%), ventilator-related outcomes (n = 6, 10.9%), unplanned extubation (n = 5, 9.1%), and symptom-related outcomes (n = 6, 10.9%). Outcomes differed by patient population and setting. It is important to broaden nurse-sensitive outcome measurement in acute/critical care settings to recognize the full spectrum of nursing's work in hospitals. When core hospital outcome measures reflect the true work of nursing, its value to patients, families, and organizations can be made visible. • Current nurse-sensitive outcomes (NSOs) in acute/critical care are inadequate. • Funding agency support and regulatory body endorsement of new NSOs are needed. • Nursing's value can be made visible by NSOs that fully reflect its work.

Tools for Relationship Between Frailty and Risk of Falls Among Hospitalised Older People with Cardiac Conditions: An Observational Cohort Study.

Relationship Between Frailty and Risk of Falls Among Hospitalised Older People with Cardiac Conditions: An Observational Cohort Study.
By:Rivas-González, Noel;López, María;Martín-Gil, Belén;+3 moreIn:Nursing Reports, Mar2025, volume 15, issue 3, page 100CINAHL
Background/Objective: Ageing favours the onset of cardiovascular diseases, frailty, and risk of falls. In the hospital setting, 47.7% of patients may be frail, and the incidence of falls may be as high as five per thousand. This study seeks to determine the relationship between frailty, risk of falls, and length of hospital stays in hospitalised older adults with heart disease. Methods: An observational study was conducted of a cohort of patients aged ≥60 years admitted to a cardiology unit (2022–2024). Frailty was assessed using Fried's phenotype, risk of falls using the J.H. Downton scale, and level of dependency using the Barthel index. Clinical variables, anthropometric measurements, and length of stay were analysed. Statistical analysis: quantitative variables were expressed as means and standard deviations, and categorical variables as frequencies. Associations were analysed using Student's t-tests, chi-squared tests, and Kruskal–Wallis tests for comparisons of three or more groups. Relationships between frailty, risk of falls, and other variables were examined using univariate binary logistic regression, with a 95% confidence interval and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: A total of 144 patients were recruited (mean age = 73.08 years [SD = 7.95]) (women = 33.30%). Frailty was associated with waist circumference in men (p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure in women (p = 0.05). Frailty was further linked to Downton scores (odds ratio [OR] = 1.565; 95% CI: 1.156–2.120; p = 0.004), age (OR = 1.114; 95% CI: 1.058–1.173; p = 0.000), Barthel index (OR = 0.902; 95% CI: 0.854–0.953; p = 0.000), and length of stay (OR = 1.101; 95% CI: 1.021–1.186; p = 0.012). Conclusions: Frailty appears to be related to Downton scores and impacts the length of hospital stays in older adults hospitalised with cardiac conditions.

Background: There are limited data regarding intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) in pregnancy for women with Type 2 diabetes. We have tested the acceptability and feasibility of an isCGM method using Libre device. Method: In a hospital-based service improvement project, 23 pregnant women (March 2022-April 2023), with Type 2 diabetes got isCGM for monitoring from 20 weeks until delivery. Women completed a structured and validated questionnaire assessing satisfaction, equipment issue, relationship with diabetes team. Results: Two-thirds of the women were satisfied with the convenience and found it reliable. 86% wanted to use it for future pregnancies, and 90% would recommend it to others. Sensor falls off was seen in three obese women and about a tenth felt the reliability was poor in extreme ranges of sugar levels. The relationship with the diabetes team was rated high. Conclusion: isCGM could be a useful and well-received tool for improving glycaemic control in pregnancies with Type 2 diabetes.

Tools for Development of a falls risk assessment scale for middle-aged and elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases in Chinese community based on AutoScore: A CHARLS study.

Development of a falls risk assessment scale for middle-aged and elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases in Chinese community based on AutoScore: A CHARLS study.
By:You, You;Zheng, Hui;Lei, Xiaohui;+5 moreIn:Public Health (Elsevier), Mar2025, volume 240, pages 167-173 (7p)CINAHL
Falls among middle-aged and elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) frequently occur in non-hospital settings. However, there is a lack of simple forecasting tools for fall risk in middle-aged and elderly patients with CVD in Chinese community. We aimed to develop an easy-to-use scoring system, even for non-professionals, to facilitate the implementation of individualized fall prevention measures. Nationwide cohort study. The study included 2280 patients over the age of 45 with CVD from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The data was divided into training (70 %) and testing (30 %) sets. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was used to refine 134 candidate variables in the training set. After that, six machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models for post-diagnosis fall risk. AutoScore, an interpretable machine learning-based clinical score generation algorithm, was then utilized to establish a fall risk prediction score. Finally, the models' performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC), Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Brier Score. LASSO regression identified 16 predictive variables for input into various models. In the test set, AutoScore achieved the highest AUC (0.7447) among the six machine learning models, showing statistically significant differences with LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Ultimately, a percentage-based questionnaire scale was developed by used AutoScore, including variables such as physical condition, psychological state, and surrounding environment, among others. The optimal threshold for predicting falls was determined to be 31 points. We have developed a practical and easily interpretable fall prediction score for middle-aged and elderly patients with CVD in community.

A service evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of a home-deployed mobile x-ray imaging service in a regional setting.
By:Eade, C.;Meertens, R.M.;Heales, C.J.;+1 moreIn:Radiography, Mar2025, volume 31, issue 2, page N.PAGCINAHL
Falls in older adults are common, leading to high rates of emergency admissions, extended hospital stays, and unnecessary use of healthcare resources. This service evaluation reports on a home-deployed imaging service using mobile X-ray equipment to explore the potential cost-effectiveness and patient benefits of facilitating imaging at the patient's place of residence. A six-month pilot program was established involving transporting portable imaging equipment to patients' homes or care facilities in Cornwall as required. Referrals were made by community clinicians via phone, and imaging results were integrated with existing hospital systems. Cost-benefit analysis was performed based on reduced ambulance usage and avoided hospital admissions. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a survey. 305 patient referrals were made, resulting in 294 imaging visits. Most referrals (64.5 %) were to patients at home, with the remainder in care facilities. The majority of imaging involved hip (41.3 %) and lower limb (23.5 %) examinations. 87.4 % of patients were discharged at the scene, with the remaining 12.6 % requiring ambulance transport. Ambulance callouts were avoided in 257 cases, potentially saving over 19 total days of ambulance handover time. Patient feedback was predominately positive. The average age of patients imaged was 83 and the average frailty score was 6 (moderately frail). The home-deployed imaging service was effective in reducing need for ambulance conveyance, number of emergency department admissions, and hospital stays, with high patient satisfaction. This pilot demonstrates the potential for mobile X-ray services to enhance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Future implementation should focus on reducing repeat imaging rates and addressing logistical challenges to optimize the service's effectiveness in different settings. Ongoing monitoring and staff training will be essential for sustainable service delivery.

Tools for Machine Learning Approaches to Predict No-Shows in Saudi Arabian Primary and General Healthcare Settings.

Machine Learning Approaches to Predict No-Shows in Saudi Arabian Primary and General Healthcare Settings.
By:Alshehri, Abdulrahman;Saeed, Abdullah;AlShafea, Abdullah;+7 moreIn:Saudi Journal of Health Systems Research, 2025, volume 5, issue 1, pages 24-40 (17p)CINAHL
Introduction: Frequent no-shows in healthcare appointments pose significant challenges, leading to wasted resources and suboptimal patient outcomes. Traditional mitigation methods, such as reminder messages and phone calls, often fall short, particularly in regions with less robust healthcare infrastructures. This study leverages machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of missing appointments using data from the Mawid scheduling system in Southern Saudi Arabia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional design was employed, focusing on visits to primary healthcare centers (PHCCs) and general hospitals. Data spanning 10 months from June 2023 to March 2024 were collected from Mawid, encompassing over one million observations and 18 features, including appointment details, patient demographics, and weather conditions. Machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN), have been developed and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The findings revealed that 55.07% of appointments were not attended. The Random Forest model exhibited superior performance with an accuracy of 0.765 and an AUC of 0.852, particularly when weather-related features were included. The ANN models also performed robustly with an AUC value of approximately 0.836. This study identified significant regional, seasonal, and environmental factors affecting no-show rates, with higher no-show rates occurring during certain months and under specific weather conditions. Regular appointments and PHCCs showed different attendance patterns than hospitals, while walk-in appointments did. Conclusion: Machine learning models, particularly random forests and ANNs, can effectively predict healthcare appointment no-shows, thereby allowing for better resource allocation and patient care. Recognizing the influence of regional and environmental factors is crucial for developing targeted interventions to reduce the no-show rates. Future research should explore integrating more contextual data to further refine these predictive models and to enhance healthcare delivery and operational efficiency.

Study Objective: We sought to determine the overall rates of traumatic injuries and whether the rates of traumatic injuries and various clinical outcomes differed among older patients presenting to a tertiarycare emergency department (ED) after a ground-level fall (GLF) and who underwent whole-body computed tomography. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥65 years of age who presented to the ED with a GLF and received a whole-body CT from January 1-December 31, 2021. Age was stratified into age groups: 65-74; 75-84; and 85+. We presented a descriptive analysis of traumatic injuries, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and all-cause mortality rates. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between increasing age, traumatic injuries, and clinical outcomes. Results: Of 638 patients in the cohort, 120 (18.9%) sustained thoracic injuries and 80 (12.5%) sustained intracranial hemorrhages. Only five (0.8%) patients sustained an intra-abdominal injury, while 134 (21.0%) were admitted to the ICU, and 31 (4.8%) died during their index hospitalization. Head injuries (odds ratio [OR] 6.21, 95% CI 3.65-10.6, P < 0.001) and thoracic injuries (OR 5.25, 95% CI 3.30-8.36, P < 0.001) were associated with increased odds of ICU admission, whereas head injuries (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41-7.31, P < 0.01) and cervical injuries (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.08-10.5, P < 0.05) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital, all-cause mortality. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of injuries sustained between the respective age groups. There was no association between increasing age and ICU admissions or in-hospital, all-cause mortality rates. Conclusion: Among patients aged ≥65 years of age who presented to the ED after a ground-level fall and underwent whole-body CT, thoracic injuries and intracranial hemorrhages were associated with increased odds of ICU admissions. We found no significant differences in injury rates or outcomes across age groups, indicating that age alone should not guide ICU admission decisions. These findings suggest that the use of whole-body CT in this population should be selective and guided by clinical judgment rather than applied universally.

Background: Malnutrition, falls, and cognitive impairment are common in older patients visiting the emergency department (ED). Early recognition of these conditions could trigger interventions to improve outcomes following ED visits. Aim: To analyze whether a simple risk screening protocol in the emergency medical services (EMS) identifies older patients at risk of ED readmission. Methods: The EMS screened the falls risk, nutritional risk, and cognition of 472 patients (age ≥ 70 years) transported to the ED of a Finnish secondary care hospital between November 2018 and July 2019. Data on the risk screening, comorbidities, and ED readmissions were collected from electronic patient records. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression, and the results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Results: Altogether 312 patients (66%) experienced 880 ED readmissions during the 12-month follow-up. Nutritional risk was associated with an increased ED readmission rate across all time categories (< 1, 1–3, 3–6, and ≥ 6 months; IRRs 1.36–1.62, p-values < 0.05). Falls risk was associated with ED readmissions from one month after the index ED visit (IRRs 1.41–1.57, p-values < 0.05). Impaired cognition had no effect on readmissions (IRRs 1.14–1.26, p-values > 0.1). Conclusions: Patients with nutritional risk or falls risk, identified by the EMS, had a higher ED readmission rate independent of comorbidity. EMS risk screening could supplement the assessment in the ED to better identify older patients who might benefit from more detailed assessment of their health status and interventions to prevent ED readmission.

Phenotyping to predict 12-month health outcomes of older general medicine patients.
By:Woodman, Richard John;Bryant, Kimberly;Sorich, Michael J.;+4 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, 02/22/2025, volume 37, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: A variety of unsupervised learning algorithms have been used to phenotype older patients, enabling directed care and personalised treatment plans. However, the ability of the clusters to accurately discriminate for the risk of older patients, may vary depending on the methods employed. Aims: To compare seven clustering algorithms in their ability to develop patient phenotypes that accurately predict health outcomes. Methods: Data was collected for N = 737 older medical inpatients during their hospital stay for five different types of medical data (ICD-10 codes, ATC drug codes, laboratory, clinic and frailty data). We trialled five unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means, K-modes, hierarchical clustering, latent class analysis (LCA), and DBSCAN) and two graph-based approaches to create separate clusters for each method and datatype. These were used as input for a random forest classifier to predict eleven health outcomes: mortality at one, three, six and 12 months, in-hospital falls and delirium, length-of-stay, outpatient visits, and readmissions at one, three and six months. Results: The overall median area-under-the-curve (AUC) across the eleven outcomes for the seven methods were (from highest to lowest) 0.758 (hierarchical), 0.739 (K-means), 0.722 (KG-Louvain), 0.704 (KNN-Louvain), 0.698 (LCA), 0.694 (DBSCAN) and 0.656 (K-modes). Overall, frailty data was most important data type for predicting mortality, ICD-10 disease codes for predicting readmissions, and laboratory data the most important for predicting falls. Conclusions: Clusters created using hierarchical, K-means and Louvain community detection algorithms identified well-separated patient phenotypes that were consistently associated with age-related adverse health outcomes. Frailty data was the most valuable data type for predicting most health outcomes.

Background: Older adults present to Emergency Departments (ED) with complex conditions, requiring triage models that support effective disposition decisions. While existing models perform well in the general population, they often fall short for older patients. This study introduces a triage model aimed at improving early risk stratification and disposition planning in this population. Methods: We analyzed the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data (2015–2019) for ED patients aged ≥ 60 years, excluding those who died in the ED or left against medical advice. Key predictors were identified using a two-step process combining LASSO and backward stepwise selection. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and calibration plots, while clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis. Risk thresholds (< 0.1, 0.1–0.5, > 0.5) stratified patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups, optimizing the balance between sensitivity and specificity. Results: Of 13,431 patients, 3,180 (23.7%) were admitted. Key predictors for admission included ambulance arrival, chronic conditions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal vital signs. The model showed strong discrimination (AUC 0.73) and good calibration, validated by 10-fold cross-validation (mean AUC 0.73, SD 0.02). Decision curve analysis highlighted net benefit across clinically relevant thresholds. At thresholds of 0.1 and 0.5, the model identified 18.9% as low-risk (91.2% accuracy) and 7.9% as high-risk (57.7%). Adjusting thresholds to 0.2 and 0.4 expanded low-risk (55.4%, 87.9% accuracy) and high-risk (14.1%, 53.7% accuracy) groups. Conclusions: This older adult–focused risk score uses readily available data to enhance early discharge, prioritize admissions for high-risk patients, and enhance ED care delivery. Highlights: Readily available triage data predict hospital admission in older adult ED patients. Key predictors include chief complaint, ambulance arrival, comorbidities, and vital signs. The Hospital Admission Model effectively stratifies patients into low- and high-risk groups. At a 0.2 threshold, 55% of patients were classified as low risk with 88% accuracy. At a 0.5 threshold, 8% of patients were classified as high risk with 58% accuracy.

Under the coconut palm – a retrospective analysis of trauma incidents caused by falling coconuts presenting to emergency department at a tertiary care centre in coastal India.
By:Deepak, A. Sai;Katyal, Aaditya;Nair, Neeraja A;+2 moreIn:International Journal of Emergency Medicine, 02/14/2025, volume 18, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Injuries due to falling coconuts are a common yet underreported form of trauma in the tropical regions. Although these might appear insignificant at first glance, the physical forces involved are potentially fatal. Despite their global prevalence, research on this subject remains scarce, making it a neglected public health concern. This study seeks to bridge these gaps by analysing the affected demographics, contributing factors and injury patterns. By enhancing the understanding of coconut fall-related injuries, this research seeks to create awareness about dangers of falling coconuts and inform the development of effective public health strategies to mitigate their impact. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted over a period of 3 years from January 2021 to December 2023 at a tertiary care centre on the southern coast of India. Patients who presented to emergency with coconut-fall related injuries were identified through a comprehensive review of nursing ledgers. Additional data including imaging, consultations & treatment details were retrieved from patient files and electronic medical records. Descriptive statistics of the recorded data like demographic variables, time of injury, injury patterns, injury severity score (ISS) and ED disposition were analysed by using Microsoft Excel 365. Results: The study population included 17 males and 12 females. Most patients were within the age group of 40–60, which comprised 48% of the total participants. The months of September and October reported the highest frequency of cases. Out of the 29 patients, 14 were farm workers who sustained coconut fall-related injuries. Injury patterns varied from mild soft tissue injuries to severe TBIs which include SDH and SAH. There were 3 patients who required surgery, and 7 patients were admitted. There were no fatalities reported, and average hospital stay was 4.5 days. Conclusion: Coconut fall-related injuries in tropical regions is a significant but less recognised public health issue. Our study shows the necessity of seasonal preventive strategies, public awareness and safety measures for high-risk population like outdoor workers and older adults. Community focussed interventions, such as regular coconut tree pruning, installation of coconut safety nets and educational campaigns will help to reduce the incidence and severity of these injuries.

Tools for Assessment of Rehabilitation Practices During Hematological Stem Cell Transplantation in the United States: A Survey.

Assessment of Rehabilitation Practices During Hematological Stem Cell Transplantation in the United States: A Survey.
By:Leite, Victor F.;Oza, Sonal;Parke, Sara C.;+5 moreIn:Rehabilitation Oncology, Apr2024, volume 42, issue 2, pages 91-99 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Rehabilitation therapy is important to treat physical and functional impairments that may occur in individuals receiving physically taxing, yet potentially curative hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs). However, there are scarce data on how rehabilitation is delivered during HSCT in real-life setting. Our objective is to assess the rehabilitation practices for adult patients hospitalized for HSCT in the United States. Methods: We conducted a 48-question online survey with cancer centers with the top 10% HSCT volumes (per American registries). We obtained data on patient characteristics, rehabilitation therapy details (timing, indication, and administering providers), physical function objective and subjective outcome measures, and therapy activity precautions. Results: Out of 21 institutions, 14 were included. Rehabilitation therapy referrals occurred at admission for all patients at 35.7% of the centers for: functional decline (92.9%), fall risk (71.4%), and discharge planning (71.4%). Participating institutions had physical therapists (92.9%), occupational therapists (85.7%), speech-language pathologists (64.3%), and therapy aides (35.7%) in their rehabilitation team. Approximately 71% of centers used objective functional measures including sit-to-stand tests (50.0%), balance measures (42.9%), and 6-minute walk/gait speed (both 35.7%). Monitoring of blood counts to determine therapy modalities frequently occurred and therapies held for low platelet or hemoglobin values, but absolute neutrophil values were not a barrier to participate in resistance or aerobic therapies (42.9%). Conclusion: Rehabilitation practices during HSCT varied among the largest volume cancer centers in the United States, but most centers provided skilled therapy, utilized objective, clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, and monitored blood counts for safety of therapy administration.

Tools for Analysis of influential factors on surgical outcomes in pediatric femur neck fractures: a single-institution retrospective study.

Analysis of influential factors on surgical outcomes in pediatric femur neck fractures: a single-institution retrospective study.
By:Taşcı, Murat;Başak, Furkan;Kemah, Bahattin;+1 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, Oct2024, volume 50, issue 5, pages 2323-2330 (8p)CINAHL
Aim: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes and identify influential factors in pediatric femoral neck fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 25 hips from 23 pediatric patients who underwent surgical intervention for femoral neck fractures were included. Data encompassing patient demographics, fracture types, surgical techniques, complications, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Factors such as fracture displacement, timing of surgery, fixation methods, and reduction quality were assessed concerning postoperative complications. Results: Falling from a height accounted for 48% of the trauma mechanisms, and avascular necrosis (AVN) was the most prevalent complication (4 hips). Although fracture displacement, bad reduction quality, and delayed surgery were more common among complicated cases, statistical significance was not attained. The study noted an association between presence of avascular necrosis and worse clinical results(rho: 0.428, p: 0.05, CI: 95%). Conclusion: Surgical treatment yielded favorable clinical outcomes; however, limitations due to the study's retrospective design, limited sample size, and single-center approach underscore the necessity for larger multicenter studies. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive investigations to better understand and manage pediatric femoral neck fractures, especially regarding factors influencing AVN and long-term outcomes.

Tools for Changes in patient experience associated with growth and collaboration in general practice: observational study using data from the UK GP Patient Survey.

Changes in patient experience associated with growth and collaboration in general practice: observational study using data from the UK GP Patient Survey.
By:Forbes, Lindsay JL;Forbes, Hannah;Sutton, Matt;+2 moreIn:British Journal of General Practice, Dec2020, volume 70, issue 701, pages e906-e915CINAHL
Background: For the last few years, English general practices - which are, traditionally, small - have been encouraged to serve larger populations of registered patients by merging or collaborating with each other. Meanwhile, patient surveys have suggested that continuity of care and access to care are worsening.Aim: To explore whether increasing the size of the practice population and working collaboratively are linked to changes in continuity of care or access to care.Design and Setting: This observational study in English general practice used data on patient experience, practice size, and collaborative working. Data were drawn from the English GP Patient Survey, NHS Digital, and from a previous study.Method: The main outcome measures were the proportions of patients at practice level reporting positive experiences of both access and relationship continuity of care in the GP Patient Survey. Changes in proportions between 2013 and 2018 among practices that had grown and those that had, roughly, stayed the same size were compared, as were patients' experiences, categorised by whether or not practices were working in close collaborations in 2018.Results: Practices that had grown in population size had a greater fall in continuity of care (by 6.6%, 95% confidence interval = 4.3% to 8.9%), than practices that had roughly stayed the same size, after controlling for other factors. Differences in falls in access to care were smaller (4.3% difference for being able to get through easily on the telephone; 1.5% for being able to get an appointment; 0.9% in satisfaction with opening hours), but were statistically significant. Practices collaborating closely with others had marginally worse continuity of care than those not working in collaboration, and no differences in access.Conclusion: Larger general practice size in England may be associated with slightly poorer continuity of care and may not improve patient access. Close collaborative working did not have any demonstrable effect on patient experience.

Tools for Traumatic head injuries in children: demographics, injury patterns, and outcomes in Saudi Arabia.

Traumatic head injuries in children: demographics, injury patterns, and outcomes in Saudi Arabia.
By:Albargi, Hussin;Alharbi, Rayan Jafnan;Almuwallad, Ateeq;+4 moreIn:International Journal of Emergency Medicine, 02/01/2025, volume 18, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Traumatic head injuries (THIs) are among the leading cause of mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in children worldwide. Most of the published literature concerning THIs arises predominantly from North America and Europe. However, only limited data about the incidence, characteristics and impact on children in Saudi Arabia exists. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of THIs in children (≤ 18 years of age) using data from the Saudi TraumA Registry (STAR) from August 2017 to December 2022. Data included patient demographic characteristics, the mechanism, type and severity of injury. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between outcomes and clinical factors. Results: We identified 466 children with THI. Most children were over six years of age (69.5%) and male (76.6%). Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) were the most common cause of THIs (51.9%), with falls being more common in infants (69.8%). Over half of the children required ICU admission. Children with higher injury severity score, heart rate at presentation to the ED, hospital stay duration, respiratory assistance and need for surgery were more likely to require ICU admission. The overall mortality rate was 7.7%, with schoolchildren (age: 6–12 years) having the highest mortality rate (10.8%). Higher rates of ICU admission were associated with increases in the injury severity score (ISS), hospital stay duration, respiratory assistance and the need for surgery. Conclusions: Children in the 6–12 year age-group had the highest mortality rate, reflecting high injury severities associated with increased ICU admissions. These findings highlight the importance of targeting preventive measures for MVCs in older children and improving trauma care for severe cases. Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

Simple Summary: Over the last decade, early-onset colorectal cancer incidence has continued to increase. The disparities in outcomes and overall survival (OS) between early-onset colorectal cancer and average-onset colorectal cancer remain controversial. The aim of our study was to compare survival rates and identify potential influential factors affecting outcomes between these two groups. Our results show better overall survival and cancer specific survival in patients with early-onset colorectal cancer which could be contributed to better general health, fewer comorbidities and higher likelihood of receiving aggressive cancer treatments. Background: Early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is defined as colorectal cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years, and its incidence has been increasing over the last decade, now accounting for 10% of all new CRC diagnoses. Average-onset colorectal cancer (AO-CRC) has shown a steady decline in its incidence and related mortality over the past 20 years. The disparities in outcomes and overall survival (OS) between EO-CRC and AO-CRC are controversial. Our study compared OS and cause-specific survival (CSS) between metastatic EO-CRC (mEO-CRC) and metastatic AO-CRC (mAO-CRC) and identified the associated factors. Methods: Data on patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, incidence, and mortality were obtained from the SEER database from 2010 to 2020. We identified 23,278 individuals aged > 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of all histological subtypes of metastatic CRC (M1 on TNM stage) using ICD-O-3 site codes. mEO-CRC and mAO-CRC were compared. OS distributions and CCS were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test to assess differences. A Cox regression model was used to assess the associations between variables. Results: mEO-CRC constituted 17.79% of the cases, whereas 82.21% had mAO-CRC. Most patients with mEO-CRC were 45–49 years old (47.66%), male (52.16%) and White (72.57%) and had adenocarcinoma histology (87.30%). Left colon tumors were most prevalent in both groups (40.26%) but were more prevalent in mEO-CRC patients than in mAO-CRC patients (49.63% vs. 38.23%, p < 0.001). Patients with mEO-CRC had higher OS (p < 0.001) and CSS (p < 0.001) than those with mAO-CRC. Patients with mEO-CRC also had significantly better median overall survival (30 months vs. 18 months, p < 0.001). The factors associated with worse OS included mAO-CRC (p < 0.001), mucinous adenocarcinoma (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.003), and a lack of surgical intervention (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Most patients with mEO-CRC fall within the range of 45 to 49 years of age. Patients with mEO-CRC were more likely to receive cancer-directed therapy (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and had better OS and CSS than those with mAO-CRC. This is likely attributable to the better performance status, fewer comorbidities, and better tolerance to cancer-directed therapy in mEO-CRC patients. The factors associated with worse OS and CSS were age > 50 years, mucinous adenocarcinoma, male sex, and no surgical treatment.

Evaluation of Patient Information Material in the Consent Process for Surgical Stabilization of Rib Fractures.
By:Hung, Gary S. L.;Gardiner, Ben;Patel, Bhavik M.In:Journal of Trauma Nursing, Sep/Oct2021, volume 28, issue 5, pages 310-315 (6p)CINAHL
Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. Background: Surgical stabilization of rib fractures is a procedure carried out in most trauma centers; however, data on evaluation of patient information material regarding this procedure are limited. The trauma service at our hospital implemented slide presentation as an adjunct tool to the consenting process for patients undergoing this procedure. Objective: The aim was to evaluate information material for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures procedure and subjective outcomes from education on components of knowledge, emotion, and behavior for patients undergoing this procedure. Methods: A one-group posttest prospective design study was conducted over 18 months at a Level I trauma center. Supplementary visual material was provided as an adjunct to the consent process of surgical rib fixation. Evaluation from the patient's perspective was undertaken utilizing the usefulness scale for patient information material. This tool was based on a tripartite model of reading, evaluating, and responding to patient information material. Results: Over the period of 18 months, 60 patients underwent surgical stabilization of rib fractures. Fifty-two (91.7%) patients reviewed the information material, and 41 (78.8%) patients completed the feedback. The results reflect that the majority of patients perceived positive responses in emotional support (M = 8.42, SD = 6.6); behavioral motivation (M = 8.57, SD = 6.4); and education on knowledge (M = 9.09, SD = 4.6). Conclusion: In this novel study, visual aids as an adjunct to the informed consent process augmented patient knowledge regarding surgical stabilization of rib fractures and received positive subjective patient feedback on knowledge about the procedure.

Conclusion: In this novel study, visual aids as an adjunct to the informed consent process augmented patient knowledge regarding surgical stabilization of rib fractures and received positive subjective patient feedback on knowledge about the procedure. Consent Patient information material USE scale Usefulness scale Visual aids SDC T Surgical interventions require patients to sign a consent form with written information about the procedure explained by a health care provider. Gleason et al. (2021) had recognized posing questions by medical staff in the current clinic setup, patient stress, and time constraints as barriers to the informed consent process. They concluded by a qualitative analysis that more input is required on necessary components of decision making. Picture-based health education for patients may increase the effectiveness of educational materials (Park & Zuniga, 2016). Stacey, Légaré, and Lewis (2017) suggested that little is known about the effect of decision aids on patients' confidence with decision making, cost, resource use, adherence to the selected option, and regret. The introduction of using visual aids for patients as an adjunct to the standard consent process has proven beneficial in improving knowledge, emotional well-being, and behavior toward accepting health care provided to them (Lennox & Wright, 2019; Rosenfeld et al., 2018). Surgical stabilization of rib fractures is an increasingly utilized procedure in the acute management of moderate to severely displaced rib fractures (Delaplain et al., 2020). New internal fixation materials and techniques are constantly emerging and recognized by thoracic and trauma care surgeons (Zhang et al., 2019). Despite advances in techniques for this procedure; there is a paucity of data on patient education. Improvement in the consent process of patients is fundamental for creating a system of care based on wellness and prevention. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient outcomes regarding the supplemental information used in the consent process for surgical stabilization of rib fractures procedure focusing on knowledge, emotion, and behavior. METHODS: This was a one-group posttest-only design study. The Gold Coast University Hospital is a 750-bed tertiary, verified Level I trauma center by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (2020). Annually, the hospital receives approximately 300 major trauma presentations (injury severity score >12), and approximately 30% of these are patients involved with chest wall injuries. Following approval from the local ethics committee (LNR/2019/QGC/54283), a prospective study over a period of 18 months (January 2019 to June 2020) was undertaken at our hospital. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients planned for the surgical rib fixation procedure, older than 18 years, understanding of basic English, and had the capacity to give consent (or next of kin in case of the intubated and ventilated patients). Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have a basic understanding of communicating in English (requiring the aid of a translator). Emergency presentations that were immediately transferred to the operating theatre secondary to worsening respiratory failure were also excluded from the study. A clinical pathway developed along the lines of Chest Wall Injury Society guidelines (Delaplain et al., 2020) has been used at our hospital since 2018 for the management of patients with blunt chest wall injury. This includes multidisciplinary team involvement, step ladder approach, and nonprogression despite adequate pain relief leading to decision for the surgical stabilization of rib fracture procedure (Figure 1). As published previously by Patel, Hung, and Wullschleger (2019), a standard surgical approach was carried out for all patients selected for the procedure. Figure 1. Isolated blunt chest trauma—patient management flowchart, 2020. GCUH = Gold Coast University Hospital; ICC= intercostal catheter. The attending surgeon would usually explain the procedure verbally to the patient prior to operation. The attending surgeon and coauthor developed the patient information tool, a seven-slide presentation on an electronic tablet (see Supplemental Digital Content, available at: http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/JTN/A33). The slides were reviewed for clinical content by the trauma service health care team at our hospital. This information was provided to the patient or next of kin at the time of consent. The formal consent for the procedure is then carried out with a locally used generic form (Queensland Government, 2020). Once consent was obtained, the electronic tablet containing the presentation slides was returned to the trauma service. Following this, the patient's next of kin were provided with a "Usefulness scale for patient information material (USE)" feedback form (Figure 2). With its ease of use irrespective of literacy level, the feedback form is a generic scale to measure subjective usefulness on the information material from a patient's perspective (Hölzel et al., 2015). This form is based on a tripartite model of reading, evaluating, and responding to patient information materials (Garner, Ning, & Francis, 2012). The third pillar of the model has the response factor being replaced with subjective usefulness factor. The form includes nine questions, which patients answered by ticking between a scale of 0–10, with 0 = strongly disagree, 5 = neutral, and 10 = strongly agree. The evaluation tool was filled postprocedure prior to discharge to allow adequate time for patient and/or next of kin to process information provided by the medical team. Figure 2. Usefulness scale for patient information material (USE) by Hölzel et al. (2015). Descriptive statistical analysis from the data collected from the usefulness scale for patient information material (USE) was used to evaluate the efficacy of this education and patient's subjective opinion on the slides for the surgical rib fixation procedure. RESULTS: Over the period of 18 months, 60 patients underwent surgical stabilization of rib fractures. Fifty-two (91.7%) patients reviewed the slide presentation during the consent process, and 41 (78.8%) patients completed the feedback form. There was male predominance, n = 32 (78%), with a median age of 57 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 34) whereas the trauma patient population during the same period was n = 363 (72.5%) male and a median age of 49 years (IQR = 47). The study group, n = 41 (100%), had blunt injury mechanism against n = 463 (92.4%) for the trauma patient population. Intentionality was unintentional for n = 40 (97.5%) for the study group and n = 444 (88.6%) for the trauma patient population. The most common mechanism for the study group was fall, n = 11 (26%), followed by car occupant injured in a transport crash at n = 10 (23%). The trauma population during the same period had the same top five mechanisms at n = 155 (31%) for falls and n = 85 (17%) for car occupant injured in a transport crash accident. The injury severity score for the study group was a mean of 22.3 with a standard deviation of 10.5, and for the trauma population for the same period, the injury severity score mean was 21.4 with a standard deviation of 9.9. Overall, the study group reflected the trauma population with injury severity score and mechanism of injury although 8 years older in age and a slightly larger bias to males (5.5%). Demographics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.

Descriptive analysis of the scores given on the basis of the knowledge, emotion, and behavioral questions is shown in Table 2. The results suggest that the majority of patients perceived positive responses in emotional support (M = 8.42) and behavioral motivation (M = 8.57), with a high positive response for knowledge (M = 9.09). TABLE 2 Usefulness Scale for Patient Information Material Patient Survey Results (n = 41): Survey Results Mean Median SD Knowledge 9.09 10 4.6 Emotion 8.42 9 6.6 Behavior 8.57 9 6.4 DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated positive scores for improvement in knowledge and slightly lower emotional and behavioral components scores. This novel study highlights the importance of visual aids in assisting knowledge improvement for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures. Informed consent is when the patients decide after they have been adequately educated about risks, benefits, and alternative treatment modalities of the given procedure to make their decision. It is the duty of health care provider to gain informed consent from the patient (Path, Imani, Danielle, & Hipskind, 2020). The patients would generally give consent to the treatment of their illness or injuries as they believe that the clinicians' expertise in recommendation and provision of the treatment is in line with standard expected at the level of their profession (Hanson & Pitt, 2017). When patients are in pain, they tend to accept any treatment options presented, relieving them from their misery. When discussing treatment options, benefits, adverse effects, and expected outcomes, the patient focuses on beneficial outcomes of the treatment and often loses attention to the possible adverse events. Also, patients accept adverse outcomes if they were informed about reasonable expectations of the procedure, ranging from benefits to potential complications. It is essential for health care professionals to provide a service that meets the patient's expectations, but more importantly, it begins with proper education of what should be expected. The unintentional use of medical jargon by the clinician may cloud the patient's understanding of the treatment. However, patient consent may still be given because of the hierarchical physician–patient relationship either due to trust in their expertise or fear that questioning may affect the relationship between clinician and patient in delivering the treatment (Lennox & Wright, 2019). Literature supports the use of visual aid interventions during the informed consent process as it improves understanding and retention of information given to the patient. Karan, Somasundaram, Michael, Shayegani, and Mayer (2014) reported that the use of multimedia aids in addition to a standard informed consent process effectively improved patient comprehension for the education of cataract surgery in a rural population. A similar study by Rosenfeld et al. (2018) demonstrated that visual aids helped children improve understanding and retention of information during the informed consent process for the appendicectomy procedure. In 2021, Stewart et al. (2021) found that using a visual aid during the consent process for colectomy increases patients' recall of risks, reduces anxiety, and improves understanding. Patients comprehend better using a visual explanation rather than trying to understand the process from conversation alone (Bobek & Tversky, 2016). Literature is uncertain as to which specific interventions are effective (Rosenfeld et al., 2018). LIMITATIONS: There are limitations to this study, the first being that participants were predominately male, and literature suggests that this could lead to a bias in results. There is an absence of control group for comparison, and thus a future multi-institution prospective randomized controlled trial might help overcome this limitation. Finally, these were fixed responses from the patients, thus preventing detailed feedback on elements of supplemental information. CONCLUSION: In this novel study, the use of visual aids as an adjunct to the informed consent process augmented patient knowledge regarding surgical stabilization of rib fractures. We received positive patient feedback. These results give us opportunities to further improve knowledge and emotional and behavioral domains of patient satisfaction. KEY POINTS: Improvement in patient education is fundamental for creating a patient-centered system of care based on wellness and prevention. The use of a visual presentation as an adjunct to the informed consent process augmented patient knowledge of surgical rib fixation procedure. Patients perceived positive emotional support, behavioral motivation, and education on knowledge.

Tools for A survey of ambulance clinicians' perceptions of recording and communicating patient information electronically.

A survey of ambulance clinicians' perceptions of recording and communicating patient information electronically.
By:Barrett, Jack William;Eaton-Williams, Pete;Mortimer, Craig ED;+2 moreIn:British Paramedic Journal, 2021, volume 6, issue 1, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Objective: Ambulance services are evolving from use of paper-based recording of patient information to electronic platforms and the impact of this change has yet to be fully explored. The aim of this study is to explore how the introduction of a system permitting electronic information capture and its subsequent sharing were perceived by the ambulance clinicians using it. Methods: An online questionnaire was designed based upon the technology acceptance model and distributed throughout one ambulance service in the south east of England. Closed-ended questions with Likert scales were used to collect data from patient-facing staff who use an online community falls and diabetic referral platform or an electronic messaging system to update GPs following a patient encounter. Results: There were 273 responses from ambulance clinicians. Most participants agreed that they used tablet computers and smartphones to make their life easier (85% and 86%, respectively). Most participants felt that referring patients to a community falls or diabetic team electronically was an efficient use of their time (81% and 81%, respectively) and many believed that these systems improved the communication of confidential patient information. GP summaries were perceived as increasing time spent on scene but most participants (89%) believed they enabled collaborative working. Overall, collecting and sharing patient information electronically was perceived by most participants as beneficial to their practice. Conclusion: In this study, the ability to electronically refer patients to community services and share patient encounters with the GP was predominantly perceived as both safe for patients and an effective use of the participants' clinical time. However, there is often still a need to communicate to GPs in real time, demonstrating that technology could complement, rather than replace, how clinicians communicate.

Tools for Does a relationship between type of hip fracture and osteoarthritis exist?

Does a relationship between type of hip fracture and osteoarthritis exist?
By:Davut, Serkan;Kalacı, AydınerIn:Journal of Surgery & Medicine (JOSAM), 2022, volume 6, issue 10, pages 863-867 (5p)CINAHL
Background/Aim: Many factors have been associated with the etiology of falls and hip fractures in the elderly. However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between osteoarthritis and hip fractures, which are common in this age group. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) and the type of hip fracture. Methods: Patients who underwent surgery in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Department between January 2017 and December 2021 were eligible to participate in this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were 60 years and older with a hip fracture and adequate medical records and radiographs of bilateral hip and knee joints met the inclusion criteria. Data concerning patient co-morbidities, type of hip fracture, whether they had OA in their hip and knee joints, and the severity of their OA were assessed. The severity of the osteoarthritis presence was categorized with using the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) classification. To categorize the patients, three groups were identified: (1) femoral neck, (2) trochanteric, and (3) subtrochanteric fracture groups. The presence and severity status of OA in the hip and knee joints and comorbidity data were compared between the groups. Results: Three-hundred forty-one patients with a M/F ratio of 148/193 are included in this study. Femoral neck fractures occurred in 142 (41.6%), trochanteric fractures in 147 (43.1%), and subtrochanteric fractures in 52 (15.2%) patients. The mean age of the cohort was 76.72 (10.165); The mean age of the patients in the trochanteric group was higher than in the subtrochanteric group (P = 0.001). No effect of any existing co-morbidities on fracture type was observed. The overall prevalence of OA in the cohort that was observed in the hip joint was 34.3% with 33.7% in males and 35.3% in females. These rates were 66.6%, 53.4%, and 76.7% in the knee joint, respectively. No difference could be observed between hip OA presence and any type of hip fracture group (P = 0.833 for right hip, P = 0.865 for left hip). Similar rates of moderate and severe hip OA were found in the femoral neck and trochanteric fracture groups. However, the frequency of moderate hip OA was lower and the frequency of severe hip OA was higher in subtrochanteric fracture group compared to other groups (P = 0.164 for right hip, P = 0.241 for left hip. Knee OA was observed to be more common in the trochanteric fracture group (P = 0.003 for the right knee, P = 0.002 for left knee) and also, the rate of severe OA was higher in the trochanteric fracture group compared to other groups (P = 0.013 for right knee, P = 0.006 for the left knee). Conclusion: In contrast to OA presence in the hip, knee OA presence and severity can be significant risk factors for occurrence of trochanteric type fractures in the elderly.

Tools for Epidemiology of proximal and diaphyseal humeral fractures in children: an observational study from the Swedish Fracture Register.

Epidemiology of proximal and diaphyseal humeral fractures in children: an observational study from the Swedish Fracture Register.
By:Daag Jacobsen, Sarah;Marsell, Richard;Wolf, Olof;+1 moreIn:BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 01/28/2022, volume 23, issue 1, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Background: Most fractures in children are fractures of the upper extremity. Proximal and diaphyseal humeral fractures account for a minority of these fractures. To our knowledge, few previous reports address these fractures. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and current treatment of proximal and diaphyseal humeral fractures by using the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR).Methods: In this nationwide observational study from the SFR we analysed data on patient characteristics, injury mechanism, fracture classification and treatment. We included patients aged < 16 years at time of injury with proximal or diaphyseal humeral fracture registered in 2015-2019.Results: 1996 (1696 proximal and 300 diaphyseal) fractures were registered. Proximal fractures were more frequent in girls whereas diaphyseal fractures were more frequent in boys. The median age at fracture was 10 years in both fracture types but patient's age was more widespread in diaphyseal fracture (IQR 5-13 compared to IQR 7-12 in proximal). In both sexes, the most registered injury mechanism was fall. Horse-riding was a common mechanism of injury in girls, whereas ice-skating and skiing were common mechanisms in boys. Most proximal fractures were metaphyseal fractures. Most diaphyseal fractures were simple transverse or oblique/spiral fractures. The majority of fractures were treated non-surgically (92% of proximal and 80% of diaphyseal fractures). The treatment method was not associated with the patient's sex. Surgery was more often performed in adolescents. The most common surgical methods were K-wire and cerclage fixation in proximal fracture and intramedullary nailing in diaphyseal fracture.Conclusion: Following falls, we found sex-specific sport activities to cause most proximal and diaphyseal paediatric fractures. Further studies on prophylactic efforts in these activities are needed to investigate whether these fractures are preventable. The majority of the fractures were treated non-surgically, although surgical treatment increased with increasing age in both sexes.Trial Registration: Not applicable. The present study is a register-based cohort study. No health care intervention had been undertaken.

Tools for Epidemiology of pelvic and acetabular fractures in a tertiary hospital in Singapore.

Epidemiology of pelvic and acetabular fractures in a tertiary hospital in Singapore.
By:Singh, Amritpal;Shu Min Lim, Amaris;Puang Huh Lau, Bernard;+4 moreIn:Singapore Medical Journal, Jul2022, volume 63, issue 7, pages 388-393 (6p)CINAHL
Introduction: Pelvic and acetabular fractures (PAFs) usually result from high-energy, potentially life-threatening accidents. They are one of the major injuries that lead to death in patients involved in such accidents. We studied the recent epidemiology of these injuries in Singapore.Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of all trauma patients who underwent surgery for PAFs from 2008 to 2016 in a tertiary trauma centre in Singapore. Data including patient demographics, mechanism of injury and associated injuries was collected.Results: A total of 169 patients were admitted for PAFs over the eight-year period. The majority (79.3%) were male. The mean age was 41 (range 13-79) years. Most patients (51.5%) were Chinese. The most common mechanisms of injury were road traffic accidents (53.8%), falls (33.1%) and crush injuries (13.0%). 46.2% sustained acetabular fractures, while 44.4% sustained pelvic fractures. PAFs were most commonly associated with upper and lower limb injuries, followed by spinal and thoracic injuries. Average of length of stay in hospital was 24 (range 2-375) days.Conclusion: PAF predominantly affects young working males. Compared to previously published local data, there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of PAFs, likely due to improved road and work safety. The demographics of PAFs have changed, with fewer injuries in females (20.7% vs. 33.3%), a reduction in the proportion of injuries in the Chinese (51.5% vs. 70.1%). While road traffic accidents remain the most common cause, crush injuries are now more prevalent (13.0%).

By:Chong, Shu-Ling;Dang, Hongxing;Ming, Meixiu;+10 moreIn:Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Apr2021, volume 22, issue 4, pages 401-411 (11p)CINAHL
Objectives: Traumatic brain injury remains an important cause of death and disability. We aim to report the epidemiology and management of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury in Asian PICUs and identify risk factors for mortality and poor functional outcomes.Design: A retrospective study of the Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Medicine Asian Network moderate to severe traumatic brain injury dataset collected between 2014 and 2017.Setting: Patients were from the participating PICUs of Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Medicine Asian Network.Patients: We included children less than 16 years old with a Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 13.Interventions: None.Measurements and Main Results: We obtained data on patient demographics, injury circumstances, and PICU management. We performed a multivariate logistic regression predicting for mortality and poor functional outcomes. We analyzed 380 children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Most injuries were a result of road traffic injuries (174 [45.8%]) and falls (160 [42.1%]). There were important differences in temperature control, use of antiepileptic drugs, and hyperosmolar agents between the sites. Fifty-six children died (14.7%), and 104 of 324 survivors (32.1%) had poor functional outcomes. Poor functional outcomes were associated with non-high-income sites (adjusted odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.11-3.29), Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8 (adjusted odds ratio, 4.24; 95% CI, 2.44-7.63), involvement in a road traffic collision (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.04-3.26), and presence of child abuse (adjusted odds ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.01-7.46).Conclusions: Poor functional outcomes are prevalent after pediatric traumatic brain injury in Asia. There is an urgent need for further research in these high-risk groups.

Challenges of reforming integrated care in the context of ACO-like organizations: A scoping review...22nd International Conference on Integrated Care, May 23-25, 2022, Odense, Denmark.
By:Côté-Boileau, Élizabeth;Denis, Jean-Louis;Badr, JanineIn:International Journal of Integrated Care (IJIC), 2022 Special Issue, volume 22, pages 1-2 (2p)CINAHL
Introduction: Health systems around the world are being redesigned to address issues of poor care coordination, weak information flows, increase in care spending, disparate safety and quality, and inequitable population health outcomes. In the past decade, Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) have risen in the health policy landscape as promising instruments to incentivize both healthcare quality and efficiency through the creation of shared accountability and shared risk delivery systems. ACO-like organizations refer to incentivized entities in the form of legal networks, including hospitals, primary care providers, specialists, community organizations and other system partners, that are financially and clinically accountable to coordinate and deliver continuums of care to attributed populations. ACOs are namely dominant in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. More recently, ACOs are growing as potential incubators for large-system care integration. However, to this day, little research has been done on the particular challenges and opportunities arising from reforming integrated in the context of ACO-like organizations. Aims, Objectives, Theory or Methods: We aim to better understand the particular challenges and opportunities for reforming integrated in ACO-like organizations. We conducted a scoping review (Summer-Fall 2021), systematically investigating six bibliographic databases to search, screen and select relevant literature ACOs and integrated care. We screened 521 papers, then completed a full-text review of 105 identified as relevant based on title and abstract. A total of 36 papers were retained for analysis. Data were extracted and synthesised through descriptive and inductive thematic analysis. Highlights or Results or Key Findings: We identify four preliminary clusters of challenges and opportunities towards reforming integrated care in ACO-like organizations. First, numerous studies support that ACOs' shared governance and accountability models raise significant challenges towards care integration. Variability in terms of organizational maturity, institutional logics, and partner engagement strategies namely emerges as factors that would influence the capacity of ACOs to establish shared governance and accountability. Second, the slow development of digital health and data-driven patient navigation functions in ACOs currently hinders population health management capacity building that is crucial to integrated care. Third, collective incentives are still in development within ACOs. An increasing body of research supports that shared risks and rewards might not be sufficient to overcome the various boundaries (clinical, financial, technical, normative, organizational) that keep system partners disintegrated. Finally, patient and community engagement as a strategy for integrated care remains premature and rarely incentivized in ACOlike organizations. Conclusions: Challenges of reforming and delivering integrated care within ACO-like organizations namely include shared governance and accountability, digital health and patient navigation capacity, collective incentives and patient engagement. Further research should focus on how ACOs may go from offering levers (financial, technical) to support care integration at the organizational level, to conveying true integration at the point of care. Implications for applicability/transferability, sustainability, and limitations: With both integrated care systems and ACO-like organizations thriving as health system priorities, we hope to provide timely and actionable knowledge on how to build better capacity and greater accountability for integrated care system-wide.

Tools for Customized Titanium Reconstruction of Orbital Fractures Using a Mirroring Technique for Virtual Reconstruction and 3D Model Printing.

Customized Titanium Reconstruction of Orbital Fractures Using a Mirroring Technique for Virtual Reconstruction and 3D Model Printing.
By:Blumer, Michael;Pejicic, Rada;Gander, Thomas;+3 moreIn:Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (02782391), Jan2021, volume 79, issue 1, pages 200.e1-200.e9 (2147481648p)CINAHL
Purpose: Early operative reconstruction using titanium mesh is a technique often used for preventing sequelae after an orbital fracture. We sought to examine the utility of patient-specific molding of the mesh with a biomodel via virtual mirroring of the nonaffected side.Methods: We retrospectively assessed the clinical and radiological outcomes of orbital fracture reconstruction using a customized titanium mesh shaped on 3D-printed biomodels in 34 unilateral orbital fracture cases. Preoperative virtual orbital reconstruction images, using the mirroring technique, were superimposed on postoperative 3D images, and clinical data from patient charts were analyzed. Orbital reconstructions were rated, and the intention to revise results intraoperatively, or during inpatient or outpatient phases, was assessed by 2 consultants and 2 residents.Results: We found that most fractures arose from falls of <3 meters or from interpersonal violence. Ophthalmic injuries included subconjunctival bleeding, ocular contusion, enophthalmos, and diplopia. Long-term sequelae at last followup were diplopia (8.8%) and mild enophthalmos (11.8%).Conclusion: Interrater reliabilities regarding consultants' intention to revise results were substantial to almost perfect at any time point. Therefore, using the mirroring technique for the virtual reconstruction of a fractured orbit and a 3D-printed biomodel to customize commercial titanium implants yields good and reliable results, enhances surgical precision, and decreases the need for intraoperative revision, as well as long-term sequelae of orbital fractures.

The impact of using "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode on the performance and satisfaction of internship nursing students in the training of fall prevention education ability: a randomized controlled trial.
By:Yang, Jie;Mao, Tianyang;Zhou, Li;+8 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 10/22/2025, volume 24, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Clinical internships are a crucial component of nursing education, offering students the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a clinical setting. Patient falls represent a common issue in hospitals and are a central focus of patient safety management. Enhancing nursing students' proficiency in fall prevention education during their internships is essential for advancing patient safety and improving future care quality. Methods: This study involved 159 nursing students who were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group, consisting of 80 students, participated in a three-step training mode labeled 'teach, exercise, and practice' Meanwhile, the remaining 79 students in the control group received training through traditional teaching methods. Both groups underwent training to enhance their skills in fall prevention education. Following the training, assessments included a theoretical examination, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), and a teaching satisfaction survey. Data collected were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and χ² test. Results: In the theoretical examination, both the experimental group and the control group demonstrated equivalent effectiveness, with significant improvements post-intervention; however, no significant differences were observed between the two groups (P = 0.884). In the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), the experimental group performed notably better in several areas: evaluation of patients and their families (P = 0.044), environmental assessment and education (P = 0.003), education on patient mobility out of bed (P < 0.001), and communication skills (P < 0.001). Regarding satisfaction, the experimental group, which followed the "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode, reported higher levels of satisfaction (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Compared to traditional teaching methods, the "teaching, exercising, and practicing" three-step training mode reinforces the knowledge among internship nursing students regarding risk assessment for falls and strengthens their ability to provide health education on fall prevention. It enhances the satisfaction of nursing students with their training. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of fall prevention theory with clinical practice for internship nursing students, thereby improving their proficiency in delivering fall prevention education.

Tools for Temporal Patterns of Patient Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility: A Retrospective Analysis.

Temporal Patterns of Patient Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility: A Retrospective Analysis.
By:Khalil, Ahmed;DeAngelo, Brock;Paulson, Andrew;+1 moreIn:American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Jul2025, volume 104, issue 7, pages 675-678 (4p)CINAHL
Patient falls are a frequent safety issue in inpatient rehabilitation settings, especially during early admission days when patients face physical limitations and unfamiliar environments. This study reveals high-risk periods for falls that align with peak patient activities and staff shift changes. The findings suggest that targeted fall prevention strategies during these times could significantly enhance patient safety and optimize staff resources in rehabilitation facilities. Falls are a significant safety concern in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, where patients often face increased risk due to functional impairments. This retrospective study examined fall trends across days after admission and daily 2-hr intervals within a single rehabilitation hospital. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant decline in fall rates over time, suggesting a decrease in fall risk as patients acclimate and improve physically. However, two peak periods for falls were identified during early morning and evening hours, aligning with heightened patient activity and staff shift changes. These findings emphasize the need for targeted fall prevention strategies during the initial days after admission and specific high-risk times of the day. Implementing tailored interventions for these critical periods may reduce fall incidents and enhance patient safety in rehabilitation settings.

Tools for Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.

Reducing Falls for Patients Receiving Hospice Care: A Quality Improvement Project.
By:Gaguski, Michele E.In:Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing, Oct2025, volume 27, issue 5, pages E241-E247CINAHL
Although patient falls in the acute care setting have been thoroughly studied, published studies exploring falls for patients receiving hospice care remain limited. Patients receiving hospice care present with considerable risk factors for falls, including physical and cognitive changes associated with a terminal diagnosis. An increasing pattern of patient fall rates was identified at the organization and a quality initiative was developed to address this aspect of patient care. The SMART aim of this project was to establish a sustainable process to decrease the percentage of patient falls from 5% to 3% in an organization's hospice regional branch within a 3-month period. This project adopted the Plan-Do-Study-Act process as its change model. A bundled intervention was introduced including early referrals to the therapy team for newly admitted patients, staff education, and providing supplemental patient education. The measurable outcome was to achieve a decrease in fall rates. Although the goal was not achieved within the 3-month timeframe, data did indicate a positive trend toward the intended goal. Results indicated ongoing opportunities for nurses to enhance reliability in making therapy referrals. However, nurses demonstrated consistency in providing supplemental education.

Importance Falls are commonly reported incidents that affect the safety of patients during inpatient hospitalization. Inpatient rehabilitation (IR) units report the highest fall rates when compared with other hospital units. Falls commonly result in patient injury and elevate episode costs. There is a dearth of information regarding characteristics of patients who fall during physical therapy sessions, which represents a unique subset of falls. Objective The aim of the study was to describe the nature of falls, characteristics of fallers, and characteristics of therapists who experienced patient falls, which occurred during physical therapy sessions in IR. Design This was an observational study which included a retrospective analysis of medical records. Setting This study examined falls occurring within 2 IR departments at a large hospital system located in an urban setting in the United States. Participants This study involved patients receiving adult IR with diagnoses including, but not limited to, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Exposures This study examined characteristics of patients who fell as compared with patients who did not fall, quantified the conditions surrounding falls, and described physical therapists who experienced patient falls. Main Outcomes and Measures Mann–Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to compare characteristics of faller and non-faller groups. Results Among the 6238 unique patient admissions, a total of 40 falls were identified. The rate of falling was 0.43 falls per 1000 patient days. The majority of falls occurred because of buckling (47.5%) and during gait training (40.0%). Falls most often occurred close to discharge (mode = 6 days prior). Fallers were younger than nonfallers (exponential power of B, ie, Exp[B], = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.04). Diagnoses representing the largest proportion of fallers included brain dysfunction/stroke (30.0%) and spinal cord injury/peripheral nerve injury (30.0%). Fallers had comorbid diabetes mellitus type 2 (Exp[B] = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.45–5.04) and received renal dialysis (Exp[B] = 3.23; 95% CI = 1.14–9.17) in a higher proportion than nonfallers. Fallers were often high functioning, the majority receiving at most minimal assistance (72.5%). Falls most often occurred with therapists who had 1 to 2 years of experience (27.5% of falls). Conclusions The rate of falls during therapy was lower than the rate of falls previously reported in similar settings. Therapists should exercise caution when managing younger patients and patients with certain diagnoses. Therapists should screen for buckling risk when prescribing higher-risk activities. Therapists with various levels of experience should receive fall prevention training. Clinical Relevance Therapists can use frequently occurring patient characteristics to screen for falling and use additional precautionary measures, particularly for patients with specific diagnoses, at higher risk for knee buckling, and of a younger age.

Background Inpatient falls are adverse events that often result in injury due to complex interactions between the hospital environment and patient risk factors and remain a significant problem in clinical settings. Objectives This study aimed to identify (1) practice variations and key issues ranging from hospital fall management protocols to incident detection, and (2) potential approaches to address these challenges. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Four general hospitals in South Korea. Methods Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using the Donabedian quality outcomes model. Data were collected retrospectively during 2015-2023 from four general hospitals on local practice protocols, patient admission and nursing data from electronic records, and incident self-reports. Content analysis of practice protocol and manual chart reviews for hospital falls incidents was conducted at each site. Quantitative analyses of nursing activities and analysis of patient falls prevention interventions were also conducted at each site. Results There were variations in fall definitions, risk-assessment tools and inclusion and exclusion criteria among the local fall management protocols. The original and modified versions of the heuristic tools performed poorly to moderately, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.54-0.74 and 0.59-0.80, respectively. Preventive intervention practices varied significantly among the sites, with risk-targeted and tailored interventions delivered to only 1.15%-49.5% of at-risk patients. Fall events were not recorded in self-reporting systems and nursing notes for 29.5%-90.6% and 4.4%-17.1% of patients, respectively. Conclusion Challenges in fall prevention included weaknesses in the design and implementation of local fall protocols and low-quality incident self-reporting systems. Systematic and sustainable solutions are needed to help reduce hospital fall rates and injuries.

Tools for Perceived Usefulness of Robotic Technology for Patient Fall Prevention.

Perceived Usefulness of Robotic Technology for Patient Fall Prevention.
By:Logsdon, M. Cynthia;Kondaurova, Irina;Zhang, Nancy;+10 moreIn:Workplace Health & Safety, Dec2024, volume 72, issue 12, pages 542-549 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Technology has the potential to prevent patient falls in healthcare settings and to reduce work-related injuries among healthcare providers. However, the usefulness and acceptability of each technology requires careful evaluation. Framed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and using the Adaptive Robotic Nursing Assistant (ARNA) to assist with patient ambulation, the present study examined the perceived usefulness of robots in patients' fall prevention with implications for preventing associated work-related injuries among healthcare providers. Methods: Employing an experimental design, subjects were undergraduate nursing students (N = 38) and one external subject (not a nursing student) who played the role of the patient. Procedures included subjects ambulating a simulated patient in three ways: (a) following the practice of a nurse assisting a patient to walk with the patient wearing a gait belt; (b) an ARNA-assisted process with the gait belt attached to ARNA; (c) an ARNA-assisted process with a subject walking a patient wearing a harness that is attached to ARNA. Block randomization was used with the following experimental scenarios: Gait Belt (human with a gait belt), "ARNA + Gait Belt" (a robot with a gait belt), and "ARNA + Harness" (a robot with a harness). Descriptive statistics and a multiple regression model were used to analyze the data and compare the outcome described as the Perceived Usefulness (PU) of a robot for patient walking versus a human "nurse assistant" without a robot. The independent variables included the experimental conditions of "Gait Belt," "ARNA + Gait Belt," and "ARNA + Harness," the subject's age, race, and previous videogame playing experience. Findings: Results indicated that PU was significantly higher in the Gait Belt + ARNA and Harness + ARNA conditions than in the Gait Belt condition (p -value <.01 for both variables). In examining potential influencing factors, the effects of race (White, African American, and Asian), age, and previous video-playing experience were not statistically significant (p -value >.05). Discussion: Results demonstrated that using robot technology to assist in walking patients was perceived by subjects as more useful in preventing falls than the gait belt. Patient fall prevention also has implications for preventing associated work-related injuries among healthcare providers. Implications: Understanding the effects of a subject's perceptions can guide further development of assistive robots in patient care. Robotic engineers and interdisciplinary teams can design robots to accommodate worker characteristics and individual differences to improve worker safety and reduce work injuries.

Tools for Implementing falls prevention patient education in hospitals - older people's views on barriers and enablers.

Implementing falls prevention patient education in hospitals - older people's views on barriers and enablers.
By:Hill, Anne-Marie;Francis-Coad, J.;Vaz, S.;+4 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 11/09/2024, volume 23, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: World falls guidelines recommend that hospitalised older patients receive individualised falls prevention education, yet no studies have sought older people's feedback on how best to deliver falls prevention education in hospitals. The objective of the study was to explore the perspectives of older people and their caregivers about barriers and enablers to implementation of a tailored hospital falls education program. Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Three focus groups and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted. A purposive sample of older people who had previous hospital admissions and caregivers of older people were selected to review a co-designed patient falls education program (the revised Safe Recovery program). They provided feedback on how to implement the program in hospital settings. Data were thematically analysed taking an deductive-inductive approach. Results: Participants were 37 older people [female n = 24 (64.9%), age range 64 to 89 years] and nine caregivers (female n = 8). The first theme was that the Safe Recovery Program resources were of high quality, enabling strong patient engagement and increased knowledge and awareness about falls prevention in hospitals. The second theme identified practical strategies to enable program delivery in hospital wards. The key enablers identified were: timing of delivery around wellness and the patient's mobility; tailoring messages for each older patient; key staff members being assigned to lead program delivery. Participants recommended that staff assist older patients to set appropriate behavioural goals in relation to preventing falls in hospitals. They also recommended that staff raise older patients' confidence and motivation to take action to reduce the risk of falls. Providing resources in other languages and alternative shorter versions was recommended to enable broad dissemination. Conclusions: Older people and their caregivers advised that implementing falls education in hospitals can be enabled by using high quality resources, delivering falls education in a timely manner and personalising the education and support to individual needs.

Tools for Multilevel factors influencing falls of older patients in hospital: The risk of hospital-induced delirium and the impact of nurse staffing.

Multilevel factors influencing falls of older patients in hospital: The risk of hospital-induced delirium and the impact of nurse staffing.
By:Kim, Jinhyun;Lee, Eunhee;Lee, SunmiIn:Geriatric Nursing, Jan2025, volume 61, pages 13-19 (7p)CINAHL
• Factors such as advanced age, the administration of multiple medications and treatments, mobility limitations, and hospital-induced delirium were identified as determinants of in-patient falls. • The occurrence of hospital-induced delirium in older patients is identified as the most significant contributor to the elevated risk of falls during their hospital stay. • Adequate nurse staffing emerges as a crucial factor in diminishing the risk of falls in older patients who exhibit predisposing risk factors. This study aimed to explore the individual and organizational factors influencing falls among older inpatients, with a particular focus on the risk posed by hospital-induced delirium and the effect of nurse staffing levels. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a national healthcare database to examine falls in hospitalized older adults, applying a mixed-effect logistic regression model Data from 391,902 patients across 580 hospitals revealed that 1.2 % of older inpatients experienced falls. Influential factors for falls included advanced age, the use of multiple medications and treatments, impaired mobility, and hospital-induced delirium. Nurse staffing levels markedly influenced the reduction of fall risks among older patients. Falls among hospitalized older adults are a frequent consequence of multifaceted risk components, highlighting the need for comprehensive fall prevention strategies and adequate.

Tools for Comparative Analysis of Two Fall Risk Assessment Tools in the Obstetric Population.

Comparative Analysis of Two Fall Risk Assessment Tools in the Obstetric Population.
By:Weigand, Anna;Kathman, Julie;Colton, Janet;+1 moreIn:Nursing for Women's Health, Apr2025, volume 29, issue 2, pages 83-90 (8p)CINAHL
To examine the relative accuracy of the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) and the Obstetric Fall Risk Assessment System (OFRAS) in predicting obstetric patients' fall risk. Retrospective comparative analysis of the MFS and the OFRAS in obstetric inpatients. A 575-bed urban teaching hospital in Hawaii. Eighty-five records of people hospitalized for childbirth. Adequate power modeling and statistical analyses were completed using the programs R packages Version 4.0.1 and SAS Version 9.4. Subsequently, a ratio of 17 fall records to 68 nonfall records (1:4) with similar dates of admission were reviewed. Investigators collected the MFS score/risk level as documented and the required data points to obtain the OFRAS fall risk score/level. Logistic regression models were fit using the MFS and OFRAS as predictors of falls. Results are expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p values to test for statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were derived from logistic regression results and graphed to compare the instruments. Areas under ROC curve (AUROCs) were calculated to display the specificity and sensitivity of the risk assessment tools. Data for 85 pregnant or postpartum people were included in the sample. Analysis of AUROCs demonstrated that the OFRAS is more sensitive and specific for obstetric patients than the MFS. The OFRAS showed significance (p <.001) in predicting falls compared to the MFS (p =.40). Associations between fall scores and falls were examined in separate conditional logistic regression models. The OFRAS demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in fall risk prediction. The MFS performed similarly to random chance regarding obstetric fall risk prediction. The potential exists to better anticipate patient falls, protect staff from injury related to patient fall, and decrease organizational risk using a population-specific tool. In the study population, the Obstetric Fall Risk Assessment System was more sensitive than the Morse Fall Scale in predicting fall risk.

Tools for Health Professional Perceptions of Delivering Hospital Falls Prevention Education—A Qualitative Study.

Health Professional Perceptions of Delivering Hospital Falls Prevention Education—A Qualitative Study.
By:Hill, Anne-Marie;Loo, Cheng Yen;Coulter, Steffanie;+5 moreIn:Western Journal of Nursing Research, May2025, volume 47, issue 5, pages 348-355 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Providing patient falls prevention education can help reduce falls in hospitals, yet research exploring staff perceptions about providing falls education in hospitals is limited. Objective: We sought to determine enablers and barriers to implementing a hospital falls prevention education program (the Safe Recovery Program) from the clinical staff perspective. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit health professionals (N = 40) from 12 acute medical and surgical wards at a 450-bed hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Participants were given the option to take part in a focus group or semi-structured interview. Data were analyzed via directed content analysis. Results: Findings were distinguished into 2 themes, being the barriers and enablers to implementing the Safe Recovery Program. Enabler subthemes were the mode and medium of delivering the program, the use of repetition to instill the learnings, identifying who is best to deliver the program, and utilizing the role of informal carers to reinforce the education. Barrier subthemes were patient cognitive impairments and patient illness, patient risk-taking behavior, timing of program delivery according to patient readiness, time and resource shortage, and communication barriers with non-English speaking patients. Conclusion: A comprehensive approach to program delivery can enable health professionals to implement evidence-based falls prevention education in hospitals. Extant factors must be considered during the implementation phase to ensure the Safe Recovery Program is sustainable and to optimize patient uptake of falls prevention education.

Patient safety is our business! Staff perspectives on implementing hospital falls prevention education.
By:Loo, Cheng Yen;Coulter, Steffanie;Watson, Carol;+5 moreIn:Health Promotion International, Feb2025, volume 40, issue 1, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
Providing patients with falls prevention education reduces falls in hospitals, yet there is limited research on what influences successful implementation at the staff, ward and hospital levels. We engaged hospital-based health professionals to identify multi-level barriers and enablers to patient falls education that could influence the implementation of a Safe Recovery program. Purposive sampling was used to recruit hospital staff (n = 40) for focus groups and one-on-one interviews. Data were analysed using content analysis and categorized using a socio-ecological framework to understand the micro, meso and macro level influences of hospital falls prevention. We identified five overarching themes, on the barriers and enablers to implementation of the Safe Recovery program. The enablers to falls prevention education included sharing the responsibility to implement the program, setting clear goals for staff, showing the impact of delivering the program, involving family to reinforce the messaging, using falls champions to upskill staff and making the resources (video and booklet) readily available to patients at all times. Barriers included insufficient time for staff to deliver falls prevention education, lack of falls prevention training for staff during their clinical training, absence of standardized protocols and clinical guidelines across hospital settings and insufficient hospital marketing to promote the program. Using a systems thinking approach, this study showed that implementation requires more advocacy and support for patient falls prevention across different tiers of the hospital system to integrate into usual care.

Teach-back communication to decrease falls in inpatient rehabilitation settings: a mixed-methods study.
By:Miles, Kim;Fotopoulos, Rennie;Hutchinson, Anastasia F.;+2 moreIn:Journal of the Australasian Rehabilitation Nurses' Association (JARNA), Aug2025, volume 27, issue 2, pages 23-32 (10p)CINAHL
Aims To evaluate the acceptability, uptake and impact of a teach-back communication intervention for inpatient falls reduction on the rehabilitation wards of a large private, not-for-profit Australian health service. Design Quasi-experimental mixed-methods design. Methods Intervention ward clinical staff received education on teach-back communication and were surveyed pre- and post-training. Post-intervention staff focus groups, patient interviews, and a retrospective audit of administrative falls data were conducted. Falls rates per 1000 bed days were analysed using process-control charts. The study adhered to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) statement. Results Before implementation, most staff expected teach-back to be effective and easy to use. These positive perceptions remained postimplementation, though staff reported increased workload and requested additional training. Documented use of teach-back in patient records was modest. Falls rates decreased but showed spikes coinciding with COVID outbreaks. Conclusion Healthcare staff perceived teach-back communication to be a useable strategy. Documentation rates were low but improved with training. Implications for patient care Teach-back communication for falls reduction can be implemented in inpatient rehabilitation settings with high levels of staff acceptability and measurable reductions to rates of patient falls on the wards. Teach-back positively impacted falls rates but did not mitigate spikes caused by disruptions to the ward environment. Robust implementation of teach-back communication strategies that are also nested within further multimodal strategies for falls reduction are required for consistency of falls reduction. Future research should explore implementational aspects of this technique to support consistent application of fall prevention for all inpatients.

Tools for Predictive Performance of the KINDER 1 Fall Risk Assessment Tool in a Regional Health System.

Predictive Performance of the KINDER 1 Fall Risk Assessment Tool in a Regional Health System.
By:Hooper, Vallire;LaFond, Cynthia M.;Stephenson, Kristi;+1 moreIn:Journal of Emergency Nursing, Jul2025, volume 51, issue 4, pages 636-643 (8p)CINAHL
Patient fall risk assessment in the emergency department poses a unique challenge as fall risk is often associated with risk factors other than inpatient falls. While there are many inpatient fall risk assessment tools, few have been used or validated in the ED environment. Therefore, this study examined the predictive performance of the KINDER 1 Fall Risk Assessment Tool in 10 emergency departments. A retrospective cohort design was used. Data were collected from November 15, 2023, to April 30, 2024, as a part of an electronic pilot of the KINDER 1 Fall Risk Assessment tool. Inclusion criteria encompassed all adult (≥18 years) ED visits during which a KINDER 1 fall risk assessment was completed. Descriptive statistics were used to describe overall sample characteristics. Predictive performance was calculated via multiple accuracy measurements. KINDER 1 assessments were completed on 64,811 patients, of which 40 patient falls met inclusion criteria for final analysis. The mean age of the patients who fell was 58.46 years (±18.38). Final sensitivity was 77.5%, and the specificity was 75.8%. Fall prevalence was 0.06%. KINDER 1 exhibited a sufficiently high degree of sensitivity and specificity, supporting an acceptable level of predictive performance. Additional research is recommended to compare the reliability and predictive validity of KINDER 1 to the emergency Hester Davis Scale and the Memorial Emergency Department Fall Risk Assessment Tool, as well as to compare the usability of the tools for nurses in a triage setting.

Tools for Remote Patient Monitoring Improves Patient Falls and Reduces Harm.

Remote Patient Monitoring Improves Patient Falls and Reduces Harm.
By:Zimbro, Kathie S.;Bridges, Charlene;Bunn, Sharon;+6 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, Jul-Sep2024, volume 39, issue 3, pages 212-219 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Minimizing patient falls and fall-related injuries within organizational constraints is a high priority for nurse leaders. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services do not reimburse hospitals for fall-related expenditures. In-person sitters are used to prevent falls but are resource intensive and costly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) may offer alternatives to in-person sitters to reduce fall-related harm. Purpose: The efficacy of RPM to reduce patient falls and fall-related injuries was explored. Methods: Electronic health record data were extracted from a 13-hospital integrated health care system. Incidence rate ratios were used to analyze the impact of RPM technology on falls and fall-related injuries. Results: When used in conjunction with standard fall precautions, RPM reduced falls 33.7% and fall-related injuries 47.4%. Fall-related expenditures decreased $304 400 with a combined estimated savings systemwide of $2 089 600 annually. Conclusions: RPM technology minimized falls and associated harm and improved patient safety, positively impacting hospital expenditures.

Evaluation of the cost‐effectiveness of a multicomponent fall prevention program in hospitalized patients.
By:Baris, Veysel Karani;Seren Intepeler, SeydaIn:Nursing & Health Sciences, Dec2023, volume 25, issue 4, pages 585-596 (12p)CINAHL
The aim of this pre‐ and post‐interventional study was to analyze the cost‐effectiveness of the multicomponent fall prevention program in hospitalized patients. To achieve this aim, cost‐effectiveness analysis performed using decision tree modeling was compared with the implementation of the fall prevention program and usual care. The primary outcome was the number of patient falls. The uncertainty in cost and effectiveness data was evaluated using one‐way sensitivity analysis, best–worst‐case scenario analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. According to cost‐effectiveness analysis, implementation of the fall prevention program was dominantly cost‐effective. As a result of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, it was revealed that, even if willing‐to‐pay per‐fall prevented value was 0, the probability of being cost‐effective was 54.4% for the fall prevention program. Economic evaluation results showed that implementing the multicomponent fall prevention program was dominantly cost‐effective in hospitalized patients. Nurses and nurse managers can benefit from economic evaluations in their decision‐making processes to implement fall prevention programs.

BACKGROUND: Globally in healthcare delivery, inpatient falls and fall-related injuries contribute to unsafe patient care environments. On two inpatient oncology units, the frequency of patient falls had increased, despite the use of a fall screening tool. OBJECTIVES: This project aimed to determine whether implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 3B Scheduled Rounding Protocol would reduce the average daily fall rate and number of fall-related injuries on two adult inpatient oncology units. METHODS: This quantitative, quasi-experimental quality improvement project evaluated the implementation of the AHRQ protocol to reduce the average fall rate and number of fall-related injuries for adult patients with cancer. FINDINGS: The average daily fall rate decreased following implementation of the AHRQ protocol, indicating clinical significance. This project's results suggest that implementing a standard fall prevention protocol can reduce the rate of patient falls.

Inpatients' experiences of falls: A qualitative meta‐synthesis.
By:Jarden, Rebecca J.;Cherry, Katherine;Sparham, Emma;+7 moreIn:Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Jan2025, volume 81, issue 1, pages 4-19 (16p)CINAHL
Objectives: Identify and synthesize published qualitative research reporting inpatient experiences of a fall to determine novel insights and understandings of this longstanding complex problem. Research Design: Qualitative meta‐synthesis. Methods: Online databases were searched to systematically identify published research reporting inpatient experiences of a fall. The included studies were inductively analysed and interpreted then reported as a meta‐synthesis. Data Sources: Databases Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid Emcare, CINAHL Complete, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global were searched on 3rd August, 2023. Results: From 10 included publications, four new themes of inpatients' experiences of a fall were constructed. Themes one, two and three related to antecedents of patient falls, and theme four related to consequences. Theme one, 'My foot didn't come with me: Physiological and anatomical changes', encompassed patients' experiences of medical conditions, medication, and anatomical changes. These aspects contributed to alterations in balance and strength, and misconceptions of capability in activities of daily (inpatient) living. Theme two, 'I was in a hurry: Help‐seeking', encompassed patients' experiences striving for independence while balancing power and control, minimizing their own needs over care of others', and unavailability of support. Theme three, 'I couldn't find the call light: Environment and equipment', encompassed patients' experiences of not being able to reach or use equipment, and environment changes. Theme four, 'It was my fault too: Blame and confidence', encompassed patients' expressions of blame after their fall, blame directed at both themselves and/or others, and impacts on confidence and fear in mobilizing. Conclusions: Inpatient falls are embedded in a complexity of individual, relational, and environmental factors, yet there are potential ways forward both informed and led by the patient's voice. Strength‐based approaches to address the tenuous balance between independence and support may be one opportunity to explore as a next step in complementing the existing multifaceted interventions. Impact: Inpatient falls are a complex and costly health safety and quality problem.Despite global initiatives in the prevention of inpatient falls, they remain intractable.This meta‐synthesis provides an in‐depth exploration of extant qualitative data on patients' experiences of falls in hospitals.Four themes were constructed expressing the inpatients' experiences: physiological and anatomical changes, help‐seeking, environment and equipment, and blame and confidence.Novel considerations for future investigation are offered, drawing from self‐determination theory and positive psychological interventions. Implications for Patient Care: This meta‐synthesis elicits new considerations for future interventions based on people's experiences of their fall in hospital, offering healthcare professionals novel directions in fall prevention. Reporting Method: The review was reported according to the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research statement (ENTREQ; Tong et al., 2012). Patient or Public Contribution: No Patient or Public Contribution. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023445279.

Tools for ROI for a Fall Prevention Intervention: Invest a Little, Save a Lot.

ROI for a Fall Prevention Intervention: Invest a Little, Save a Lot.
By:Cooper, Adam S.In:Nursing Administration Quarterly, Jul-Sep2024, volume 48, issue 3, pages 248-252 (5p)CINAHL
Patient falls within the hospital setting continue to be a significant challenge globally with almost one million hospital falls occurring in the U.S. annually. Recent calculations showed that the average total cost of a hospitalized patient fall was $62,521. One evidenced-based tool that has been shown to be effective is a colorful laminated poster, Fall TIPS poster, that was designed to engage and involve the patient in their fall prevention. One academic medical center utilized this implementation showing a successful return on investment (ROI). This project used a pre-post implementation design. After a successful pilot using the poster on one unit, the implementation was spread to all Adult Acute Care units (n = 10) within the institution. The outcome measures were fall and fall with injury counts and rates. The process measure was the completion of the fall prevention poster measured via audits. The calculation of ROI was completed using a four-step framework. The outcome data of fall and fall with injury showed a decrease from the pre-intervention months with both the fall count and rate decreasing by 23% and the fall with injury count and rate decreasing by 40%. The overall ROI calculation estimated an ROI of $982,700. The successful results from this project support the evidence that shows this program and the use of the Fall TIPS poster helps reduce patient falls within the hospital and yields a favorable ROI.

Preventing Falls Utilizing Remote Patient Observation...American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) 101st Annual Conference, October 31-November 3, 2024, Dallas, Texas.
By:Halgren, Anne;Larche, James;Vizvarie, MelissaIn:Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Apr2025, volume 106, issue 4, pages e52-e53CINAHL
To integrate best practices for patients who experienced an unwitnessed fall, the Falls Reduction Team at the University of Vermont Medical Center Inpatient Rehabilitation investigated the effect of Remote Patient Observation (RPO) video monitoring on the rate of repeat falls. This presentation describes a Quality Improvement project initiated after a patient experienced an unwitnessed fall, followed by a subsequent fall with injury. As a result of Root Cause Analysis, we instituted a process that any patient with an unwitnessed fall be put on Remote Patient Observation (RPO) for at least 24 hours. RPO is an effective video monitoring tool with evidence that it helps prevent falls. The goals of this before-after intervention trial were to enable closer assessment of the patient's ability to call appropriately, create opportunities to promote patient education, determine whether the patient had behaviors putting them at greater risk of fall, and produce safer patient outcomes. The University of Vermont Medical Center Inpatient Rehabilitation program is a 20-bed hospital unit serving a patient population aged 18 and over. Any patient who experienced an unwitnessed fall was placed on RPO for at least 24 hours. We instituted RPO intervention on September 15, 2022. Overall falls and repeat falls were compiled for this study for 19.5 months preceding and subsequent to this intervention, from February 1, 2021 through April 30, 2024. The primary study outcome measured was the rate of repeat patient falls following the implementation of RPO. A secondary measured outcome was overall fall rates before and after the intervention. Rates of repeat falls following an unwitnessed initial fall decreased from 11 out of 34 (32.4%) preintervention, to 3 repeat falls out of 37 unwitnessed falls (8.1%) postintervention. However, the overall rate of falls did not decrease significantly. A two-sample t test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in mean rates of falls (per 1000 occupied bed-days) when comparing the overall falls preceding (mean, 7.062; SD, 3.753) and following (mean, 7.309; SD, 3.191) the RPO intervention t (38)=−0.224, P =.824. While our total data set is still small, the trend is encouraging, and our nursing-led Falls Reduction Team will continue tracking the outcome of RPO on monthly repeat fall rates, using this data to both inform and improve patient safety outcomes. none.

Tools for Fall Event Reports of a Tertiary-Care Hospital: A Retrospective Analysis.

Fall Event Reports of a Tertiary-Care Hospital: A Retrospective Analysis.
By:Usta, Dilara;Ersoy, Neşe Altınok;Korkmaz, Fatoş;+3 moreIn:Cyprus Journal of Medical Sciences, 2024, volume 9, issue 1, pages 43-50 (8p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND/AIMS: The current study aimed to perform a retrospective analysis of fall events in a tertiary-care hospital and identify the related risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was conducted in a 1,160-bed-capacity tertiary-care hospital in Ankara between June 2016 and June 2017. The sample comprises 241 patient falls among 1,009 fall events in the facility between 2006 and 2016. Data were retrospectively collected with patient preassessment forms, daily nursing documentation forms, and daily medication order protocols. Means and standard deviations for continuous variables, frequency distributions for categorical variables, and chi-square analysis for the correlation between two categorical variables were used. RESULTS: Of the patients with files investigated, 42.7% were aged from 18 to 65 years, 59.3% were male, 74.1% had a chronic disease, 40.3% could complete daily-life activities independently, and 32% were using medication that increased fall risks. Of the fall events, 29.5% occurred in the pediatric clinics, 29.5% in surgery, and 28.2% in internal medicine clinics. 35.2% occurred during the night shift, and 33% occurred within the first three days of admission. Additionally, 35.7% of the fall events happened due to not taking appropriate safety precautions, 20.2% due to not using the nurse call button, 64.7% were in the patient's room, and 32.6% were due to syncope. CONCLUSION: It was revealed that the riskiest interval for patient falls is in the first three days of admission and during the night shift. While evaluating fall risks, sociodemographic, medical, environmental, and fall-related independent variables should be considered together. It is recommended that fall risk assessment tools be revised by reviewing patients' specific care needs and clinical conditions.

Tools for The impact of safety culture, quality of care, missed care and nurse staffing on patient falls: A multisource association study.

The impact of safety culture, quality of care, missed care and nurse staffing on patient falls: A multisource association study.
By:Alanazi, Faisal Khalaf;Lapkin, Samuel;Molloy, Luke;+1 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Oct2023, volume 32, issue 19/20, pages 7260-7272 (13p)CINAHL
Aims: To examine the association between nursing unit safety culture, quality of care, missed care and nurse staffing levels, and inpatient falls using two data sources: incidence of falls and nurses' perceptions of fall frequency in their units. The study explores the association between the two sources of patient falls and identifies if nurses' perceptions of patient fall frequency reflect the actual patient falls recorded in the incident management system. Background: Inpatient falls are associated with severe complications that result in extended hospitalisation and increased financial consequences for patients and healthcare services. Design: A multi‐source cross‐sectional study guided by the STROBE guidelines. Methods: A purposive sample of 33 nursing units (619 nurses) from five hospitals completed an online survey from August to November 2021. The survey measured safety culture, quality of care, missed care, nurse staffing levels and nurses' perceptions of patient fall frequency. In addition, secondary data on falls from participating units between 2018 and 2021 were also collected. Generalised linear models were fitted to examine the association between study variables. Results: Nursing units with strong safety climate and working conditions and lower missed care were associated with lower rates of falls using both data sources. Nurses' perceptions of the frequency of falls in their units were reflective of the actual incidence rate of falls, but the association was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Nursing units with a strong safety climate and better collaborations between nurses and other professionals, including physicians and pharmacists, were associated with lower incidents of patient falls. Relevance to Clinical Practice: This study provided evidence for healthcare services and hospital managers to minimise patient falls. Patient or Public Contribution: Patients who had experienced a fall, which was reported in the incident management system, from the included units in the five hospitals were part of this study.

Tools for Using Quality Indicator Codes to Identify Patients' Fall Risk in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities.

Using Quality Indicator Codes to Identify Patients' Fall Risk in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities.
By:Wright, Jonathan R.;D'Ausilio, Jamie;Holmberg, Janene M.;+4 moreIn:Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Sep2023, volume 104, issue 9, pages 1394-1401 (8p)CINAHL
To discover if quality indicator (QI) codes are associated with patient falls in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). This retrospective cohort study explored differences between patients who fell and those who did not fall. We analyzed potential associations between QI codes and falls using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. We collected data from electronic medical records at 4 IRFs. In 2020, our 4 data collection sites admitted and discharged a total of 1742 patients older than 14 years. We only excluded patients (N=43) from statistical analysis if they were discharged before admission data had been assigned. Not applicable. Using a data extraction report, we collected age, sex, race and ethnicity, diagnosis, falls, and QI codes for communication, self-care, and mobility performance. Staff documented communication codes on a 1-4 scale and self-care and mobility codes on a 1-6 scale, with higher codes representing greater independence. Ninety-seven patients (5.71%) fell in the 4 IRFs over a 12-month period. The group who fell had lower QI codes for communication, self-care, and mobility. When adjusting for bed mobility, transfer, and stair-climbing ability, low performance with understanding, walking 10 feet, and toileting were significantly associated with falls. Patients with admission QI codes below 4 for understanding had 78% higher odds of falling. If they were assigned admission QI codes below 3 for walking 10 feet or toileting, they had 2 times greater odds of falling. We did not find a significant association between falls and patients' diagnosis, age, sex, or race and ethnicity in our sample. Communication, self-care, and mobility QI codes appear to be significantly associated with falls. Future research should explore how to use these required codes to better identify patients likely to fall in IRFs.

Tools for Prioritising patients for hospital occupational therapy to reduce inpatient falls: A retrospective case-control study to identify predictive patient falls risk factors.

Prioritising patients for hospital occupational therapy to reduce inpatient falls: A retrospective case-control study to identify predictive patient falls risk factors.
By:Harper, Kristie J;Mast, Emily;Carter, Grace;+3 moreIn:British Journal of Occupational Therapy, Nov2023, volume 86, issue 11, pages 747-754 (8p)CINAHL
Introduction: Prompt identification of patients susceptible to falls is required by occupational therapists to initiate early falls prevention and management strategies. This study identified the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors of patients who experience early inpatient falls (within 48 hours of admission). Method: A retrospective case-control study was completed at a tertiary hospital. Data were extracted from medical records. Adults aged 18 years and older, admitted with any diagnosis, to any ward within the hospital between July 2019 and June 2020 were included. Cases were identified as those who fell within 48 hours of admission and controls did not experience a fall. Results: The study sample included 218 patients (109 cases and 109 control patients). Most falls occurred in the patient's room (n = 54) or bathroom (n = 47), as a result of slipping (n = 50) or while patients were toileting (n = 32). Multivariate regression analysis identified significant predictors of inpatient falls, including unassisted mobilisation (odds ratio (OR) 5.25), impaired balance (OR 7.25), reduced muscle strength (OR 5.25) and impulsivity (OR 19.57). Receiving occupational therapy reduced risk of falling by 81%. Conclusion: Falls risk factors that are predictive of early inpatient falls should be identified at admission and used to prioritise patients for occupational therapy.

Tools for What Health Care Staff Who Experienced Assisted Patient Falls Can Teach Us: Implications for Fall and Fall Injury Risk.

What Health Care Staff Who Experienced Assisted Patient Falls Can Teach Us: Implications for Fall and Fall Injury Risk.
By:Chavez, Margeaux;Bradley, Sarah E.;Lind, Jason;+5 moreIn:AJN American Journal of Nursing, Nov2023, volume 123, issue 11, pages 24-33 (10p)CINAHL
Purpose: This quality improvement project had three aims: to identify common assisted falls scenarios, describe staff members’ experiences with and risk perceptions of such falls, and explore factors that influenced their perceptions. The overarching goal was to gain useful insight for the development of assisted fall– related strategies and policies. Methods:In the fall of 2020, 16 staff members from 13 health care facilities were purposively recruited and interviewed. Transcript summaries of these interviews, along with secondary narrative data from employee and patient injury databases, were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results:According to staff members’ accounts, assisted falls most commonly took place in patient rooms or bathrooms when patients were ambulating or transferring. The interviewees described assisting falls by grabbing or holding the patient or by using their own body to brace or steady the patient. Interview and secondary narrative data noted various injuries that occurred during assisted fall events. These injuries most often involved the lower back (among staff) and the legs (among patients). Most interviewees perceived that using proper body mechanics would prevent injury. Conclusions: Interviewees’ experiences with assisted falls indicate areas of improvement for fall preven)tion. The perception that using proper body mechanics will protect staff from injury may be a misconception. Although the literature reports mixed findings concerning whether staff should assist patient falls, this project’s results led us to conclude that there is no safe way to physically assist a falling patient without risk of staff injury.

Tools for Hospital falls clinical practice guidelines: a global analysis and systematic review.

Hospital falls clinical practice guidelines: a global analysis and systematic review.
By:McKercher, Jonathan P;Peiris, Casey L;Hill, Anne-Marie;+4 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Jul2024, volume 53, issue 7, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background Hospital falls continue to be a persistent global issue with serious harmful consequences for patients and health services. Many clinical practice guidelines now exist for hospital falls, and there is a need to appraise recommendations. Method A systematic review and critical appraisal of the global literature was conducted, compliant with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Epistemonikos, Infobase of Clinical Practice Guidelines, Cochrane CENTRAL and PEDro databases were searched from 1 January 1993 to 1 February 2024. The quality of guidelines was assessed by two independent reviewers using Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Global Rating Scale and Appraisal of Guidelines of Research and Evaluation Recommendation Excellence (AGREE-REX). Certainty of findings was rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis. Results 2404 records were screened, 77 assessed for eligibility, and 20 hospital falls guidelines were included. Ten had high AGREE-REX quality scores. Key analytic themes were as follows: (i) there was mixed support for falls risk screening at hospital admission, but scored screening tools were no longer recommended; (ii) comprehensive falls assessment was recommended for older or frail patients; (iii) single and multifactorial falls interventions were consistently recommended; (iv) a large gap existed in patient engagement in guideline development and implementation; (v) barriers to implementation included ambiguities in how staff and patient falls education should be conducted, how delirium and dementia are managed to prevent falls, and documentation of hospital falls. Conclusion Evidence-based hospital falls guidelines are now available, yet systematic implementation across the hospital sector is more limited. There is a need to ensure an integrated and consistent approach to evidence-based falls prevention for a diverse range of hospital patients.

Tools for Factors Associated with Acute Injurious Falls in Elderly Hospitalized Patients: A Multicenter Descriptive Study.

Factors Associated with Acute Injurious Falls in Elderly Hospitalized Patients: A Multicenter Descriptive Study.
By:Geskey, Joseph M.;Yuksel, Jaylan M.;Snead, Jessica A.;+3 moreIn:Joint Commission Journal on Quality & Patient Safety, Nov2023, volume 49, issue 11, pages 604-612 (9p)CINAHL
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hospital-Acquired Conditions (CMS-HAC) links Medicare payments to health care quality. Experiencing a serious disability or death associated with a fall in a health care facility based on diagnosis codes has been identified as an opportunity for improvement. Multiple factors contribute to an inpatient fall, including medications that affect cognition in older adults. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the commonly prescribed classes of medications on the CMS-HAC falls and trauma definition in US hospitals in a large inpatient database from 2019 to 2021. The authors analyzed data from 835 hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Data Base between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021, on patients ≥ 65 years of age with CMS-HAC patient falls and trauma codes. Using logistic regression and stepwise Poisson regression analysis, the authors identified demographic, clinical, and hospital-related variables associated with falls meeting the CMS-HAC definition. The top 20 prescribed drug classes in these patients were also identified. Among 11,064,024 patient encounters, 5,978 met the CMS-HAC definition of a serious fall. Patients who experienced a serious fall were significantly more likely to be > 79 years of age (p < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–1.37), have a history of prior falls (p < 0.001, OR 2.30, 95% CI 2.11–2.50), have a code for dementia (p < 0.001, OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.40–1.60), and have higher anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scores (p < 0.001, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13–1.14). Specific medication classes associated with CMS-HAC falls were first-generation antihistamines (p < 0.00, OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.35), second-generation antihistamines (p ≤ 0.001, OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13–1.19), and atypical antipsychotics (p < 0.001, OR 1.18, CI 1.13–1.29). Patients who experience a fall meeting the CMS-HAC fall definition are significantly more likely to have a prior history of falling, dementia, and a higher ACB score. Results from this study may inform future quality improvement work aimed at reducing injurious falls.

Background: Patient falls are a major adverse event in psychiatric inpatient care. Purpose: To model the risk for patient falls in seclusion rooms in psychiatric inpatient care. Methods: Sociotechnical probabilistic risk assessment (ST-PRA) was used to model the risk for falls. Data sources were the research team, literature review, and exploration groups of psychiatric nurses. Data were analyzed with fault tree analysis. Results: The risk for a patient fall in a seclusion room was 1.8%. Critical paths included diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, the mechanism of falls, failure to assess and prevent falls, and psychological or physical reason. The most significant individual risk factor for falls was diagnosis of schizophrenia. Conclusions: Falls that occur in seclusion events are associated with physical and psychological risk factors. Therefore, risk assessment methods and fall prevention interventions considering patient behavioral disturbance and physiological risk factors in seclusion are warranted.

Background/Aims Falls are a key patient safety concern because of the associated physical injuries, emotional impact and financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of falls and assess the potential risk factors among hospitalised patients in a medium-sized acute care hospital in Queensland, Australia. Methods This was a retrospective descriptive study using routinely collected information. The study was conducted in a medium-sized public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Characteristics of patients, their fall risk classification and circumstances of patient falls were extracted from the incident report provided by the hospital. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results A total of 677 patient fall incidents were documented on the hospital's electronic incident system from 2015-17. The majority of falls (98%) occurred in inpatient units and caused no or minimal harm to patients. Older age groups (75-84 years and 85-94 years) made up the greatest proportion of patients who fell. Falls were largely related to toileting activities. The most common locations for inpatient falls were the bed, bedside trolley or treatment chair. Conclusions Intervention studies are needed to develop and evaluate procedures to prevent falls, particularly for activities with a high risk of falls, such as toileting, and for older patients.

Objectives: Patient falls are highly prevalent in hospitals, and are considered a complicated challenge. Thus, the present research assessed the prevalence of the fall risk assessment and the correlated factors among elderly inpatients. Methods: The present analytical and cross-sectional research was conducted with 419 elderly patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The data collection instrument consisted of two parts including demographic information and the Johns Hopkins fall risk assessment tool (JHFRA). A convenience sampling method was used to select the elderly patients staying in the general wards of Allameh Bohlool Gonabadi Hospital, Gonabad City, Iran. The data analysis was done in SPSS software, version 23 using descriptive (frequency, Mean±SD) as well as inferential statistics (logistic linear regression analysis). Results: The Mean±SD of participants' age was 72.09±9.46 and the prevalence of the fall risk was 85.9%. Statistically significant correlations were found between the elderly inpatients' fall risk and their age (P=0.001), sex (P=0.012), and cardiovascular diseases (P=0.001). Discussion: Considering the high prevalence of fall risk among elderly inpatients, it is essential to plan for preventing and reducing the rate of elderly inpatients' falls.

Background: Inpatient falls with harm have severe implications on patients and the health care system. Purpose: We implemented a zero harm approach to falls prevention, which aimed to reduce falls with injury by 25% within 1 year. Methods: We implemented a multifaceted and multidisciplinary quality improvement falls prevention strategy that included facilitating organization-wide education, adopting the Morse Fall Risk Assessment tool, displaying real-time unit-specific falls rates, and implementing a transparent root-cause analysis process after falls. Our outcome measure was falls with injury per 1000 patient-days. Results: We observed a decrease in the rate of patient falls with injury from 2.03 (baseline period) to 1.12 (1 year later) per 1000 patient-days. We also observed increases in awareness around falls prevention and patient safety incident reporting. Conclusions: Our zero harm approach reduced falls with injury while improving our patient safety culture.

Patient falls while under supervision: trends from incident reporting.
By:Roberts, MatthewIn:British Journal of Nursing, 08/06/2023, volume 32, issue 11, pages 508-513 (6p)CINAHL
In one large UK hospital trust, data from the electronic incident reporting system were studied to determine the number of falls within one division taking place while patients were under enhanced supervision. This supervision was commonly carried out by registered nurses or healthcare assistants. It was noted that, despite increased supervision, patients were still falling and when they did the degree of harm they suffered was often greater than for those patients not under supervision. It was also noted that more male patients fell under supervision than female patients, although the reasons for this were not clear, suggesting an area for further research. A large number of patients fell while in the bathroom, where they were often left alone for periods of time. This shows an increasing need to find a balance between maintaining patient dignity and ensuring patient safety.

Introduction: Patient falls are a preventable public health problem, and they are among the most reported safety incidents in the hospital. We used a hospital safety reporting system to examine the nature of reported falls in the perioperative setting at an academic tertiary center. Methods: In this retrospective study, reports of perioperative safety events listed as "Falls" between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed for severity level and specific event type. Results: Out of 8337 safety reports from 2014 to 2020, 86 were "fall" related (1%). The most common "fall" event type was "ambulating with assistance and the severity level reported was mainly level 1 (no harm, did reach patient, 63%) followed by level 2 (temporary or minor harm, 28%). One of the most frequently reported types of perioperative falls was from a bed or stretcher (15% of falls)". Conclusions: Our safety data reporting system identified falls as a safety event that causes patient harm in the perioperative setting that could be preventable with a multifaceted interdisciplinary approach. Risk managers can use these data to implement strategies to reduce falls such as creating screening protocols to identify high‐risk patients, educating and training healthcare personnel, and optimizing operating room, hospital, and equipment design.

Beyond Radiation Exposure: Investigating the Complex Dimensions of Safety in the Catheter Laboratory.
By:Uğrak, UğurIn:Lokman Hekim Health Sciences, Aug2025, volume 5, issue 2, pages 151-159 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: Catheterization laboratories are high-risk clinical environments where complex procedures are performed under time pressure and with radiation exposure. Qualitative research addressing the lived experiences of healthcare professionals in cath labs remains limited. This study aims to explore in depth the perceptions and experiences of healthcare professionals working in cath labs regarding patient and staff safety. Methods: This study used a qualitative research design based on interpretative phenomenological analysis. A total of 24 healthcare professionals from various occupational groups working in cath labs across Türkiye were included in the study through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed inductively using a thematic content analysis. Data analysis was performed using NVivo 10 software. Results: Two main themes emerged from this study: Risks and Measures. The most frequently reported risk was radiation exposure, followed by infection, pharmaceutical hazards, patient falls, excessive workload, and untrained personnel. Regarding safety measures, participants emphasized the importance of using radiation protective equipment, maintaining accurate medical records, adhering to aseptic practices, implementing fall prevention strategies, ensuring adequate staffing levels, verifying patient identities, and maintaining patient confidentiality and privacy. Discussion and Conclusion: This study revealed that safety practices in cath labs are predominantly shaped around radiation hazards, while a more holistic safety perspective tends to be overlooked. The lack of standardized protocols and heavy reliance on individual initiative were particularly noteworthy. The findings suggest that comprehensive and systematic strategies addressing all dimensions of risk are necessary to establish a sustainable safety culture in cath labs.

Characteristics of Inpatients With Blood Cancers Who Experience a Fall: A Retrospective Study.
By:Spanolios, Anna;Rogers, Leslie;Hartranft, Susan;+5 moreIn:Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing, Apr2022, volume 26, issue 2, pages 204-209 (6p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Inpatients with cancer are at the greatest risk for falling. Although studies have identified the characteristics of patients with cancer who fall, few studies have focused on the characteristics of patients with blood cancers who fall. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to identify characteristics of inpatients with blood cancers who fall and implement fall-mitigation efforts through an enhanced assessment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: Descriptive design and retrospective review of 51 patient falls were used to identify characteristics of inpatients with cancer who fell. FINDINGS: The majority of patients who fell were male (n = 33), and most falls occurred during the day shift (n = 24). Few patients were listed on the Morse Fall Risk Scale for mental status and forgetting limitations (n = 7), and most were not identified as a high fall risk (n = 30). The majority of falls were associated with toileting needs (n = 32). Patients spent a mean of 12.73 days in the hospital before falling. Thirty-two patients received chemotherapy prior to their fall, 25 of whom received neurotoxic chemotherapy.

Hospital-acquired falls are a continuing clinical concern. The emergence of advanced analytical methods, including NLP, has created opportunities to leverage nurse-generated data, such as clinical notes, to better address the problem of falls. In this nurse-driven study, we employed an iterative process for expert manual annotation of RNs clinical notes to enable the training and testing of an NLP pipeline to extract factors related to falls. The resulting annotated data corpus had moderately high interrater reliability (F-score=0.74) and captured a breadth of clinical concepts for extraction with potential utility beyond patient falls. Further research is needed to determine which annotation tasks most benefit from nursing expert annotators, to optimize efficiency when tapping into the invaluable resource represented by the nursing workforce

Tools for Within-unit bed moves in a short-stay in-patient unit are associated with increased falls.

Within-unit bed moves in a short-stay in-patient unit are associated with increased falls.
By:Mui Kin Kok;Vlaskovsky, Philip;Low, Evelyn;+2 moreIn:Australian Health Review, 2021, volume 45, issue 4, pages 497-503 (7p)CINAHL
Objective. This study evaluated a patient's likelihood of a fall using information available at the time of presentation to a short-stay acute medical unit (AMU) with a high patient turnover rate and estimated the effect of within-unit bed moves on the occurrence of in-patient falls. Methods. This study was a 3-year retrospective cross-sectional study of 28 713 consecutive admissions comparing patients who fell and patients who did not fall. Factors assessed included premorbid falls risk factors, presenting issues and within-unit bed moves. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with patients who fell. Each admission was treated as a unit of measure. Results. Of 28 713 admissions, 182 (0.6%) involved at least one fall event. The fall rate was 5.67 falls per 1000 occupied bed days. Premorbid cognitive impairment (odds ratio (OR) 4.88), a presenting issue of confusion (OR 2.92) and a fall immediately before admission (OR 2.49) were associated with patients who fell (all P, 0.001). Each bed move corresponded to a 27% increase in the odds of a fall (OR 1.27; P = 0.027). Conclusion. Premorbid cognitive impairment was the strongest risk factor for an in-patient fall on the unit. Withinunit bed moves significantly increased the risk of an in-patient fall and should be minimised.

Tools for Relationship between nursing students' views on robot nurses, artificial intelligence applications, and their innovativeness.

Relationship between nursing students' views on robot nurses, artificial intelligence applications, and their innovativeness.
By:Cankara, Sevim;Ergin, Eda;ÇINAR Yücel, SebnemIn:Teaching & Learning in Nursing, Jul2025, volume 20, issue 3, pages e783-e790CINAHL
• Nursing students were predominantly classified as traditionalists, with lower innovativeness scores among those who believed AI-powered robots would benefit nursing. • While students favored AI-powered robots for tasks such as preventing patient falls, measuring height and weight, and changing bed linens, they opposed their use in invasive procedures like vascular access, blood drawing, and wound dressing. • Enhancing nursing students' innovativeness requires integrating courses on informatics, AI, and robotics into the curriculum, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and providing educational environments that encourage creativity and technological adaptability. Understanding nursing students' perspectives on artificial intelligence and robotics is essential for preparing them for future practice. This study aimed to investigate the opinions of nursing students in western Turkey on innovation, robot nurses, and artificial intelligence applications. This descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted in line with STROBE guidelines, included 341 nursing faculty students (January–May 2022). Data were collected using the "Student Information Form," "Questionnaire on Students' Innovative Ideas, Artificial Intelligence, and Robot Nurses," and the "Individual Innovativeness Scale" (IIS). The three most preferred tasks for AI-powered robots were "Measuring patients' height and weight" (92.1%), "Preventing falls" (91.2%), and "Changing bed linens" (90%). The mean IIS score was 54.05 ± 13.66. Participants were categorized as traditionalists rather than innovators. Those who believed AI-powered robots would benefit nursing had lower IIS scores.

Tools for Patient Falls, Nurse Communication, and Nurse Hourly Rounding in Acute Care: Linking Patient Experience and Outcomes.

Patient Falls, Nurse Communication, and Nurse Hourly Rounding in Acute Care: Linking Patient Experience and Outcomes.
By:Gliner, Melissa;Dorris, Joe MS;Aiyelawo, Kimberley;+3 moreIn:Journal of Public Health Management & Practice, Mar/Apr2022, volume 28, issue 2, pages E467-E470CINAHL
Research has consistently found a link between hourly nurse rounding and patient outcomes, including reduced falls, reduced pressure ulcers, reduced call light usage, and improved patient experience; however, little research exists specific to patient falls and nurse rounding in acute care settings. This study adds to the body of knowledge by statistically quantifying and providing linkages between nurse rounding frequency and patient fall rates using data from 31 military treatment facilities comprehensively over a period from fiscal year (FY) 2017 through FY2019. Poisson regression results indicated that hourly nurse rounding was associated with a reduction of more than 21% in fall rates (incidence rate ratio = 0.79, P <.01) relative to infrequent rounding, and poorly rated nurse communication was associated with an 8.6-fold increase in patient fall rates relative to highly rated nurse communication (incidence rate ratio = 8.6, P <.01).

Tools for Physical Design Factors Contributing to Patient Falls.

Physical Design Factors Contributing to Patient Falls.
By:Pati, Debajyoti;Valipoor, Shabboo;Cloutier, Aimee;+4 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Apr2021, volume 17, issue 3, pages e135-e142CINAHL
Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify physical design elements that contribute to potential falls in patient rooms. Methods: An exploratory, physical simulation–based approach was adopted for the study. Twenty-seven subjects, older than 70 years (11 male and 16 female subjects), conducted scripted tasks in a mockup of a patient bathroom and clinician zone. Activities were captured using motion-capture technology and video recording. After biomechanical data processing, video clips associated with potential fall moments were extracted and then examined and coded by a group of registered nurses and health care designers. Exploratory analyses of the coded data were conducted followed by a series of multivariate analyses using regression models. Results: In multivariate models with all personal, environmental, and postural variables, only the postural variables demonstrated statistical significance—turning, grabbing, pushing, and pulling in the bathroom and pushing and pulling in the clinician zone. The physical elements/attributes associated with the offending postures include bathroom configuration, intravenous pole, door, toilet seat height, flush, grab bars, over-bed table, and patient chair. Conclusions: Postural changes, during interactions with the physical environment, constitute the source of most fall events. Physical design must include simultaneous examination of postural changes in day-to-day activities in patient rooms and bathrooms. Among discussed testable recommendations in the article, the followings design strategies should be considered: (a) designing bathrooms to reduce turning as much as possible and (b) designing to avoid motions that involve 2 or more of the offending postures, such as turning and grabbing or grabbing and pulling, and so on.

By:Daley, Brittney;Fetherman, Brandee;Turner, JoanneIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, Jan-Mar2021, volume 36, issue 1, pages 57-61 (5p)CINAHL
Background: There is limited research addressing how to optimize both staffing and patient outcomes with the use of technology to reduce falls during hospitalization. Purpose: We compared the effects of 2 staffing patterns in conjunction with the use of an electronic surveillance system on patient falls on an inpatient medical unit. Methods: Study participants were randomized to receive electronic surveillance system monitoring with a dedicated rounder or electronic surveillance system without a dedicated rounder. Falls during the study period were analyzed. Results: Of 1032 patients, there were 8 falls during the 3-month study. Six falls occurred in the intervention group, with no rounder, and 2 occurred in the group with a dedicated rounder. The data showed no statistical significance but had clinical implications. Conclusion: In response to our findings, the dedicated rounder will function as a mobility technician, providing support to our nursing staff and a resource for fall risk patients.

Elektronik Olay Bildirim Sistemi Üzerinden Raporlanan Hasta Düşmelerinin Değerlendirilmesi.
By:ASLAN, Yasemin;TARIM, MehveşIn:Journal of Nursology, Jun2022, volume 25, issue 2, pages 101-105 (5p)CINAHL
Objective: This research was performed in order to evaluate inpatient falls, which were reported through the electronic incident reporting system in a university hospital. Methods: This research is a descriptive, retrospective study. The population of the study consists of the incident reporting registry, which was reported through the electronic incident reporting system between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2017, in a university hospital in Istanbul, regarding the falls of 159 inpatients. In the research, no additional sample selection was made and the entire population was regarded as the sample. Institution permission and ethics committee approval was received before conducting the research. In the analysis of the data, "World Health Organization International Classification for Patient Safety and Severity Scale of Harm" was used to describe the severity of injury for patients. Results: The fall rate of patients among all reports was found to be 10.6%. It was determined that 73.6% of the patients were in the adult group, while 26.4% of them were in the pediatric group. It was identified that the patients fell mostly while being mobilized (78.6%) and in the ward (56%). When the factors that induced the fall of patients were examined; it was detected that 39% of the patients fell due to loss of balance-weakness, while 25.2% of them fell because of dizziness and 5.7% of them due to wet/slippery floor. It was noticed that any factors that caused patients to fall were not specified in 16.4% of the incident reports. It was determined that 34.6% of the patients were not injured, whereas 45.9% of them were harmed mildly and 1.9% of them were harmed severely by cause of falling. Conclusion: It has been found out that the patients fell mostly due to loss of balance, weakness, and dizziness during being mobilized in the ward. Incident reporting systems, which include all the information needed about patient falls, can provide an opportunity for corrective action for incidents that may occur due to falls.

Tools for The Effect of Toolbox Trainings on Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

The Effect of Toolbox Trainings on Nursing Sensitive Quality Indicators: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
By:Kara, Bircan;Sönmez, BetülIn:Journal of Nursing Scholarship, May2025, volume 57, issue 3, pages 439-451 (13p)CINAHL
Introduction: Toolbox training or toolbox talks is short‐term training to improve occupational health and safety practices in various sectors. These on‐the‐job trainings provide employees with opportunities to ask questions and share experiences, facilitating the enhancement of workplace safety practices. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of toolbox trainings provided to nurses on nursing‐sensitive quality indicators (pain management, pressure ulcer, patient falls, peripheral venous catheter complications, and adverse event reporting) in the workplace. Design: Randomized controlled, pre‐test, post‐test, and control group design. Methods: Before the toolbox training, pretest measurement instruments were used for the nurses in both the experimental and control groups, and the nursing‐sensitive quality indicators were monitored by two independent observers. Toolbox training was provided to nurses in the intervention group on their shift in the respective units. Both groups were followed up at the 8th and 12th weeks after the training. Descriptive tests, independent sample t‐tests for intergroup comparisons, and repeated and mixed ANOVA for intragroup comparisons were utilized in data analysis. Results: Significant differences were found between pre‐test and post‐test scores of the nurses in the group who received toolbox training in terms of falls, pressure ulcers, pain management, peripheral venous catheter, and adverse event reporting (p < 0.01). It was observed that the application scores significantly differed among all nurses who received toolbox training according to the findings of both observers, generally increasing in the second follow‐up compared to the first, but decreasing in the third follow‐up (p < 0.05). Evaluated according to unit quality indicators, it was determined that the number of patient falls (mean 4.04, 2.32, and 1.95 respectively), pressure ulcer occurrences (mean 4.48, 2.69, and 2.45 respectively), and the number of patients experiencing peripheral venous catheter complications decreased (mean 26.79, 16.46, and 15.42 respectively) in the units where nurses who received toolbox training worked. The average number of correctly managed pain patients (mean 37.82, 71.61, 69.07 respectively) and the number of reported adverse events (mean 2.79, 6.60, 6.42 respectively) were observed to increase in the second follow‐up but decrease in the third follow‐up. Conclusions: As a result, it was determined that on‐the‐job trainings increased nurses' knowledge level regarding nursing‐sensitive quality indicators, improved their practices, and enhanced unit quality indicators. According to the findings of this study, on‐the‐job trainings provided to nurses were found to be an effective method, and it is recommended to use them in addition to traditional training methods in nurses' in‐service education. Clinical Relevance: There is a growing demand for shorter and different training methods in nurses' education. In addition to classical in‐service training methods, this training method, which was applied for the first time in the field of nursing, contributed to the improvement of quality indicators sensitive to nursing. Our findings emphasize that it will be useful to use this training method in future studies on improving and developing nursing‐sensitive quality indicators. Trail Registration: The study has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05853588)

Tools for Decreasing Hospital-acquired Pressure Injuries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 5-step Quality Improvement Approach.

Decreasing Hospital-acquired Pressure Injuries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 5-step Quality Improvement Approach.
By:Nuseir, Deema;Sinno, Maya;Wilson, Mary-Agnes;+13 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Apr2025, volume 21, issue 3, pages 151-158 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) are common adverse events with large burdens on patients and health systems. In 2020, during the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of admitted patients with HAPIs of stage II and above in our health system rose from 2.92% to 3.80%. In response to rising HAPI rates across our own hospital system, we established a quality aim to reduce HAPIs stage II and above by 50% over 3 years from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We designed a multidisciplinary quality improvement HAPI prevention program. Our initiative had 5 key aspects: fostering governance and accountability, providing education and training, changing clinical practice, monitoring data and evaluation, and modernizing environments and equipment. Results: HAPI rate (outcome measure) declined from 3.8% at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 1.6% (58% reduction, P <0.00001) postintervention. Braden Risk Assessment Tool use (process measure) improved from 88.2% to 92.2%. (P =0.00024). Rate of patient falls with injuries (balancing measure) decreased from 1.5 per 1000 patient days to 1.0 per 1000 patient days (P =0.0009). Conclusions: Despite working during the COVID-19 pandemic where organizational resources were constrained and infection control practices were heightened, a multidisciplinary QI HAPI prevention program, informed by evidence-based practices and supported by access to real-time data, led to an ∼58% reduction in the HAPI rate.

OBJECTIVE: To explore a workload intensity staffing (WIS) model's effect on nurse and patient outcomes. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relationship between WIS and nurse and patient outcomes. METHODS: A point-based workload intensity tool was developed and implemented to determine the level of care for adult inpatients. Before and after implementation, nurses provided feedback on staffing practices. Rates for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), and patient fall rates were collected. RESULTS: Nurses indicated that patients were equally distributed among nurses (pre-score mean [ M ] = 3.7 vs post M = 3.6, P = 0.609) and that patient work intensity was incorporated into patient assignments (pre M = 3.4 vs post M = 3.5, P = 0.717). A significant negative trend was revealed for patient falls per 1000 patient-days (b = −0.063, P = 0.010) with fewer falls post-WIS implementation and a significant decrease in falls with injury (b = −0.085, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in CAUTI and CLABSI rates for pre- versus post-WIS and WIS implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Although these initial results are promising, more research is needed on WIS and nurse and patient outcomes.

Patients who have Parkinson disease require individualized medication regimens to optimize care. A review of the medication management of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease found significant departures from the patients' home regimen. Medication regimens are often altered by health care teams unfamiliar with Parkinson disease–specific care in order to conform to standard hospital medication orders and administration times, potentially resulting in increased patient falls, delirium, and mortality. A nurse-led multidisciplinary team consisting of pharmacy, nursing, informatics, neurology, and quality personnel implemented a quality improvement (QI) project between July 2020 and July 2022 to identify patients with Parkinson disease, including those with a secondary diagnosis and those undergoing deep brain stimulation, and customize medication management in order to reduce length of stay, mortality, falls, falls with harm, and 30-day readmissions. The QI project team also evaluated patient satisfaction with medication management. Among patients with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease, the proportion who had medication histories conducted by a pharmacy staff member increased from a baseline of 53% to more than 75% per month. For all patients with Parkinson disease, those whose medication history was taken by a pharmacy staff member had orders matching their home regimen 89% of the time, whereas those who did not had orders matching the home regimen only 40% of the time. Among patients with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease, the length-of-stay index decreased from a baseline of 1 to 0.94 and observed-to-expected mortality decreased from 1.03 to 0.78. The proportion of patients experiencing a fall decreased from an average of 5% to 4.08% per quarter, while the proportion of patients experiencing a fall with harm decreased from an average of 1% to 0.75% per quarter. The rate of 30-day readmissions decreased from 10.81% to 4.53% per quarter. Patient satisfaction scores were 1.95 points higher for patients who had medication histories taken by pharmacy than for those who did not (5 versus 3.05). How a nurse-led multidisciplinary team implemented a quality improvement project to identify patients with Parkinson disease and customize medication management in order to reduce length of stay, mortality, falls, falls with harm, and 30-day readmissions.

By:Mousavipour, Sayedeh-Somayyeh;Ebadi, Abbas;Saremi, Mahnaz;+2 moreIn:Archives of Trauma Research, Apr-Jun2022, volume 11, issue 2, pages 65-70 (6p)CINAHL
Background and Objectives: One of the important indicators of patient safety and quality of hospital care is the patient's fall. Patient falls are among the most crucial issues in the field of Never Events that will affect the health-care systems, and it is necessary to be considered to improve the safety of hospitalized patients. The present study was conducted to investigate the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) in Iran. Methods: In this prospective observational study, the reliability of the MFS was investigated through the inter-rater reliability. The researcher as the first evaluator and an experienced nurse as the second evaluator screened 180 patients in two educational hospitals in Tehran, Iran, between March and May 2021, using the access method with a MFS. The percentage of agreement of the evaluators was assessed using the Cohen's kappa coefficient, and sensitivity and specificity were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The results showed that the percentages of agreement between the two assessors in the patient fall history index, in the index of secondary diagnoses, in the index of assistive devices, in the index of IV therapy and heparin lock, in the index of gait/transferring, and in the index of mental status were 0.869, 0.916, 0.871, 1.00, 0.898, and 0.815, respectively. The MFS reliability was obtained by an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.825, sensitivity of 66.7, and specificity of 81.6. Conclusion: The reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of the Morse scale are relatively favorable. Therefore, it is suggested that a patient fall screening scale be designed to measure all dimensions related to the correct assessment of the patient in terms of clinical conditions and nonclinical factors related to patient fall.

Tools for A Machine Learning-Based Fall Risk Assessment Model for Inpatients.

A Machine Learning-Based Fall Risk Assessment Model for Inpatients.
By:Liu, Chia-Hui;Hu, Ya-Han;Lin, Yu-HsiuIn:CIN: Computers, Informatics, Nursing, Aug2021, volume 39, issue 8, pages 450-459 (10p)CINAHL
Falls are one of the most common accidents among inpatients and may result in extended hospitalization and increased medical costs. Constructing a highly accurate fall prediction model could effectively reduce the rate of patient falls, further reducing unnecessary medical costs and patient injury. This study applied data mining techniques on a hospital's electronic medical records database comprising a nursing information system to construct inpatient-fall-prediction models for use during various stages of inpatient care. The inpatient data were collected from 15 inpatient wards. To develop timely and effective fall prediction models for inpatients, we retrieved the data of multiple-time assessment variables at four points during hospitalization. This study used various supervised machine learning algorithms to build classification models. Four supervised learning and two classifier ensemble techniques were selected for model development. The results indicated that Bagging+RF classifiers yielded optimal prediction performance at all four points during hospitalization. This study suggests that nursing personnel should be aware of patients' risk factors based on comprehensive fall risk assessment and provide patients with individualized fall prevention interventions to reduce inpatient fall rates.

Objective: The knowledge and competence levels of nurses regarding patient safety play a large role in decreasing the potential risks that patients can face. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the training given to nurses about patient safety. Material and Methods: This study is a quasi-experimental study with a one-group pretest-posttest design. The study sample comprised 258 nurses employed in a training and research hospital in Ankara. Data were collected through an eight-question demographic characteristics and 23-question patient safety survey form administered between October 4-28, 2022. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance test were used to analyze the data. Results: In the study, nurses' post-test mean score (96.59±5.492) was found to be higher than their pre-test mean score (85.59±13.182, p<0.001). In the pre-test, the highest correct answer rate was in "verbal communication", (92.2%) and the lowest correct answer rate was in "medication administration" (30.2%) areas. In the post-test, the highest correct answer rate was in "patient falls" (%99.6) and the lowest correct answer rate was in "medication administration" (%65.1) areas. Additionally, the nurses' mean scores varied according to age, gender, education level, and previous patient safety training. Conclusion: Nurses' knowledge and awareness of patient safety play an important role in providing safe and quality service. This study shows that nurses' knowledge levels regarding patient safety were significantly increased through education. For this reason, it is recommended that institutions support nurses with continuous in-service training programs for patient safety.

Introduction: Intrahospitalary falls are among the national and international priorities in terms of quality of care. Although several intrinsic and extrinsic elements associated with patient falls have been recognized, information and evidence on these elements are lacking in Colombia. Thus, we aimed to characterize the falls of patients and their associated factors in a high-complexity hospital in Bogotá, Colombia between 2013 and 2016. Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study based on the data obtained from the registry of falls that occurred during the study period in a high-complexity hospital in Bogotá, Colombia was carried out. Descriptive statistical analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Of the 951 falls that occurred between 2013 and 2016, 63.1% were classified as adverse events. According to the severity of falls, 54.2% falls were "moderate" and "severe." According to the demographic characteristics, 53.0% patients were men, 65.5% were ≥65 years old (median: 71 years, minimum: 16 years, maximum: 98 years), and 23.2% had circulatory diseases. The following factors were found to be associated with an increased risk for a fall that culminated in an adverse event: being a woman (95% ci = 1.08--1.87), night shift (95% ci; or = 1.09--2.03), and clinical (95% ci = 1.36--4.84) and surgical specialties (95% ci = 1.14--4.46). Conclusion: Patient falls are important adverse events that require intervention in hospital institutions. Intrinsic elements (mainly age) and extrinsic elements (work shift and medical specialty) were identified to cause harm to the patient in the event of a fall.

BACKGROUND: Job-related psychosocial factors have a substantial effect on the occurrence of adverse events among healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: An analytical and descriptive survey was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the occurrence of patient safety incidents and psychological factors. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 177 nurses who were asked about patient safety events over six months. Repetitive patient safety incidents were selected by examining medical records and interviewing specialists. Also, psychological factors were assessed using job content questionnaire (JCQ). RESULTS: Repetitive patient safety incidents were involved medication administration error, pressure ulcer and skin-muscular injuries, patient falls, inability to CPR patients, blood transfusion reactions, and death due to human error. The findings showed that 92 participants (52%) had at least one case of patient safety incident. Among patient safety incidents, medication administration error and death due to human error had the highest and lowest repletion, respectively. Nurses training, job insecurity and peer support were significant predictors of different aspects of patient safety (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Proper collaboration between new and experienced nurses can have a significant impact to reduce patient safety incidents. In addition, nursing training can be a good way to understand risk points in medical errors.

Tools for Development of a Novel Computational Model for Evaluating Fall Risk in Patient Room Design.

Development of a Novel Computational Model for Evaluating Fall Risk in Patient Room Design.
By:Novin, Roya Sabbagh;Taylor, Ellen;Hermans, Tucker;+1 moreIn:Health Environments Research & Design Journal (HERD) (Sage Publications, Ltd.), Spring2021, volume 14, issue 2, pages 350-367 (18p)CINAHL
Objectives: This study proposes a computational model to evaluate patient room design layout and features that contribute to patient stability and mitigate the risk of fall. Background: While common fall risk assessment tools in nursing have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, they focus on intrinsic factors and medications, making risk assessment limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. Methods: We use literature to inform a computational model (algorithm) to define the relationship between these factors and the risk of fall. We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Results: Based on available data, the algorithm includes static factors of lighting, flooring, supportive objects, and bathroom doors and dynamic factors of patient movement. This preliminary model was tested using four room designs as examples of typical room configurations. Results show the capabilities of the proposed model to identify the risk associated with different room layouts and features. Conclusions: This innovative approach to room design evaluation and resulting estimation of patient fall risk show promise as a proactive evidence-based tool to evaluate the relationship of potential fall risk and room design. The development of the model highlights the challenge of heterogeneity in factors and reporting found in the studies of patient falls, which hinder our understanding of the role of the built environment in mitigating risk. A more comprehensive investigation comparing the model with actual patient falls data is needed to further refine model development.

High-risk medication dispenses to patients with a prior fall or hip fracture represent a potentially dangerous disease-drug interaction among older adults. The research team quantified the prevalence, identified risk factors, and generated patient and provider insights into high-risk medication dispenses in a large, community-based integrated health system using a commonly used quality measure. This was a mixed methods study with a convergent design combining a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data, individual interviews of primary care physicians, and a focus group of patient advisors. Of 113,809 patients ≥ 65 years with a fall/fracture in 2009–2015, 35.4% had a potentially harmful medication dispensed after their fall/fracture. Most medications were prescribed by primary care providers. Older age, male gender, and race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White were associated with a reduced risk of high-risk medication dispenses. Patients with a pre-fall/fracture medication dispense were substantially more likely to have a post-fall/fracture medication dispense (hazard ratio [HR] = 13.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.91–13.61). Both patients and providers noted that providers may be unaware of patient falls due to inconsistent assessments and patient reluctance to disclose falls. Providers also noted the lack of a standard location to document falls and limited decision support alerts within the EHR. High-risk medication dispenses are common among older patients with a history of falls/fractures. Future interventions should explore improved assessment and documentation of falls, decision support, clinician training strategies, patient educational resources, building trusting patient-clinician relationships to facilitate long-term medication discontinuation among persistent medication users, and a focus on fall prevention.

Tools for Using an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) to Screen Older Adults for Fall Risk in an Outpatient Primary Care Setting.

Using an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) to Screen Older Adults for Fall Risk in an Outpatient Primary Care Setting.
By:Ogbuokiri, Utokia;Ahaghotu, EzenwanyiIn:Online Journal of Nursing Informatics, 2022, volume 26, issue 2, pages 10-21 (12p)CINAHL
Background: Older adults face an increased risk for falling and resulting injury due to age-related physiological changes (Sharif et al., 2018). Effective fall risk screening programs in the primary care setting may be a promising approach to reduce the incidence of falls within this population (Siegrist et al., 2016). The use of technology can be beneficial in supporting care delivery and further reducing the risk. Purpose: This article discusses the implementation of a fall risk screening and reduction program in a primary care setting. The program uses resources of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths & Injuries (STEADI) Initiative and the development of an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI). This study aimed to increase community-dwelling older adult safety by identifying and reducing fall risk. Clinical Relevance: ACASI is an effective alternative to traditional interview methods due to its speed in data capture and the potential for increased accuracy of self-reported data. Introducing ACASI technology in nursing practice is an innovative approach to collecting patient data in a manner that limits physical interaction, reduces bias, and promotes safe social practices, especially when considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. Approach: Participants were recruited from an outpatient facility and consented to participate in the study. Chart reviews were conducted to identify eligible participants. To determine the baseline fall risk scores, questionnaires were presented to participants in the form of an ACASI. This technology was used to communicate the assessment questions and facilitate data collection. Evidencebased informational materials were administered to participants to provide education on fall prevention safety and limiting fall risk. Eight weeks after receiving education on fall risk reduction behavioral and environmental modifications, a follow-up, ACASI- formatted questionnaire was administered to assess for a change in fall risk scores. Results: The research findings demonstrated a significant reduction in fall risk scores (t (40) = -2.220, p =.032) from pre- to postassessment. Overall fall risk scores among the participants decreased by 43% within a 12-week timeframe. One in four adults age 65+ report falling, resulting in over 50% of all injury-related deaths (Haddad et al., 2018). Individuals who suffer from falls are not only predisposed to injury and untimely death, but also decreased mobility, decreased independence, hospitalization, and nursing home placement (Phelan et al., 2016). The cost to medically treat a fall is approximately $10,000 in direct fees (Dellinger, 2017). Costs associated with caring for fall-related injuries exceed $30 billion each year (Phelan et al., 2016). The National Patient Safety Goals, established by The Joint Commission (TJC) in 2003, is a safety and quality improvement program to help healthcare organizations target concerning areas of need (The Joint Commission, 2022a). Sentinel Event Alerts, which warn healthcare organizations about risks to patient safety, are included with the safety goal reports. Injurious patient falls have regularly ranked in the top 10 among the TJC's list of Sentinel Events (The Joint Commission, 2022b). Most falls among older adults result from a combination of risk factors. Approaches to assess and manage modifiable risk factors have been identified as effective interventions for individuals at risk of falling (Phelan et al., 2016). Primary care practitioners can play a key role in identifying and reducing fall risk among patients by identifying and discussing risk factors during regular office visits. The physiologic changes and high incidence of falls in the elderly make it necessary to conduct regular fall risk assessments and interventions among this population (Siegrist et al., 2016). Among the leading fall risk assessment resources that have recently been developed is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths & Injuries) Initiative (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017c). STEADI offers healthcare providers a standardized approach to conduct fall risk screenings, assessments, and interventions for older adults (Howland et al., 2018). Technology can assist in screening patients for fall risk in the form of an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI). An ACASIadministered survey is a method of data collection that allows participants to complete interviews on their own without the presence of a human interviewer. Questions and response options are displayed as digital text on a personal electronic device and read aloud to participants. The participants listen to the pre-recorded questions and respond by selecting their answers directly on the screen. ACASI is believed to improve the quality of data collection by minimizing data entry errors. Additional benefits of using ACASI, as opposed to traditional survey questionnaires, include increased privacy for participants, accessibility for illiterate participants, reduced staff time for interviewing, and increased data validity for sensitive questions (Kane et al., 2016). In this study, an ACASI was developed and administered to participants in tandem with CDC STEADI (2017c) resources, as part of a fall risk screening and reduction program to identify and reduce the risk of falling among community-dwelling older adults.

Tools for Factors influencing the implementation of falls prevention practice in primary care.

Factors influencing the implementation of falls prevention practice in primary care.
By:McConville, Alexandra;Hooven, KatieIn:Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, Feb2021, volume 33, issue 2, pages 108-118 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Patient falls in the primary care setting are a complex problem and are detrimental to the independence and quality of life of older adults. Objectives: The purpose of this integrative review is to identify what factors influence the implementation of fall prevention practice in the primary care setting. This review explores qualitative and quantitative research published between 2004 and 2018 on barriers to fall prevention management in primary care. Data sources: The authors conducted a systematic search of the evidence and identified 18 articles which met the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Five themes were identified that described barriers in fall risk management in the primary care setting. These included provider beliefs and practice, lack of provider knowledge, time constraints, patient engagement, andfinancial issues. Implications for practice: The lack of screening and assessment regarding fall risk identification demonstrates a gap in the management of older adults in primary care. Using the evidence- and theory-based Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries toolkit and algorithm is an effective method to assist practitioners with fall assessment and preventative measures.

Tools for The SAFEST review: a mixed methods systematic review of shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention.

The SAFEST review: a mixed methods systematic review of shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention.
By:Drahota, Amy;Felix, Lambert M.;Raftery, James;+5 moreIn:BMC Geriatrics, 06/01/2022, volume 22, issue 1, pages 1-28 (28p)CINAHL
Background: Shock-absorbing flooring may minimise impact forces incurred from falls to reduce fall-related injuries; however, synthesized evidence is required to inform decision-making in hospitals and care homes.Methods: This is a Health Technology Assessment mixed methods systematic review of flooring interventions targeting older adults and staff in care settings. Our search incorporated the findings from a previous scoping review, MEDLINE, AgeLine, and Scopus (to September 2019) and other sources. Two independent reviewers selected, assessed, and extracted data from studies. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute tools, undertook meta-analyses, and meta-aggregation.Results: 20 of 22 included studies assessed our outcomes (3 Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs); 7 observational; 5 qualitative; 5 economic), on novel floors (N = 12), sports floors (N = 5), carpet (N = 5), and wooden sub-floors (N = 1). Quantitative data related to 11,857 patient falls (9 studies), and 163 staff injuries (1 study). One care home-based RCT found a novel underlay produced similar injurious falls rates (high-quality evidence) and falls rates (moderate-quality evidence) to a plywood underlay with vinyl overlay and concrete sub-floors. Very low-quality evidence suggested that shock-absorbing flooring may reduce injuries in hospitals (Rate Ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84, 2 studies; 27.1% vs. 42.4%; Risk Ratio (RR) = 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.93, 2 studies) and care homes (26.4% vs. 33.0%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91, 3 studies), without increasing falls. Economic evidence indicated that if injuries are fewer and falls not increased, then shock-absorbing flooring would be a dominant strategy. Fracture outcomes were imprecise; however, hip fractures reduced from 30 in 1000 falls on concrete to 18 in 1000 falls on wooden sub-floors (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.78; one study; very low-quality evidence). Staff found moving wheeled equipment harder on shock-absorbing floors leading to workplace adaptations. Very low-quality evidence suggests staff injuries were no less frequent on rigid floors.Conclusion: Evidence favouring shock-absorbing flooring is uncertain and of very low quality. Robust research following a core outcome set is required, with attention to wider staff workplace implications.Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42019118834 .

Associations and Predictive Pathways Between Shared Governance, Autonomy, Magnet Status, Nurse-Sensitive Indicators, and Nurse Satisfaction: A Multisite Study.
By:McGinnis, Juli;Dee, Vivien;Rondinelli, June;+1 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, Apr-Jun2024, volume 39, issue 2, pages 159-167 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Evidence is limited to the effects of shared governance (SG) and autonomy on nurse-sensitive indicators (NSIs). Purpose: To explore the effects of SG, autonomy, and Magnet status on nurse and patient outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a convenience sample of 404 nurses from 4 hospitals. Descriptive analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and path analysis were conducted to identify hypothesized associations and predictive pathways among study variables. Results: Nurse managers reported higher perceptions of SG, autonomy, and satisfaction than staff nurses. SG and autonomy were significant predictors of patient falls and hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Nurses' autonomy, SG, and Magnet accreditation were significant predictors of nurse satisfaction. Conclusions: Leadership support of SG and autonomous practice are key strategies to improve nurse satisfaction and NSI outcomes.

Nurses' perceptions of hourly rounding in Jordanian hospitals: A national survey.
By:Hamdan, Khaldoun;Zahran, Zainab;Allari, Rabia S.;+1 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Management, Oct2022, volume 30, issue 7, pages 2945-2956 (12p)CINAHL
Aim: This study aims to explore nurses' perceptions of hourly rounding in Jordanian hospitals. Background: Hourly rounding is a standardized and systematic process conducted by nurses to anticipate and address needs in hospitalized patients. The evidence on hourly rounding is mixed, and research is needed to affirm the benefits of implementing hourly rounding across different contexts. Method: A cross‐sectional correlational design was used. A convenient sample of 1378 nurses was recruited from one military hospital, two university‐affiliated hospitals, four governmental hospitals and four private hospitals in Jordan. The Hourly Rounding Questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, t test, one‐way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis H test were used to analyse the data. Results: The highest agreements between nurses were on the items related to the implementation of hourly rounding in terms of 'preventing patient falls' 1211 (87.9%), 'preventing hospital‐acquired pressure ulcers' 1201 (87.2%) and 'addressing patients' position' 1199 (87%). The lowest agreements between nurses were on the items related to the involvement of nurses in the decision‐making process and sense of ownership 268 (19.4%) and the availability of continued support and resources 239 (17.3%). Female nurses, nurses who often work on a shift rotation, nurses working in private hospitals and respiratory units had a positive perception of hourly rounding. Implications for Nursing Management: Findings will inform nursing leaders and policy developers about the implementation of hourly rounding from nurses' perspectives. A protocol should accompany hourly rounding for robust evaluation to measure the impact of this process change with the involvement of nurses in the decision‐making process.

Tools for Assessing the effectiveness of an occupational musculoskeletal ınjury prevention program for paramedic students: A quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest study.

Assessing the effectiveness of an occupational musculoskeletal ınjury prevention program for paramedic students: A quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest study.
By:Tok, Fatma;Canıtez, Naile;Aydemir, TuğbaIn:International Emergency Nursing, Sep2025, volume 82, page N.PAGCINAHL
• Paramedics should use their bodies effectively and apply ergonomics to prevent patient falls and injuries. • This study found that training improved paramedic students' knowledge and performance in patient transport. • A systematic training program can help paramedic students learn and apply injury-preventing movement strategies. Paramedics must apply appropriate body mechanics principles when providing emergency care, actively engaging their bodies to prevent physical injuries and protect patients from falls and harm. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a occupational musculoskeletal injury prevention program provided to paramedic students on their level of knowledge regarding body mechanics principles and their performance in patient transport practices. This semi-experimental study employs a pretest–posttest single-group design. The study population consisted of 60 paramedic program students at a university's health services vocational school during the 2022–2023 academic year's fall semester. Students received theoretical and practical training on body mechanics, following the Body Mechanics Training Guide. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24. The mean age of the students was 20.40 ± 1.65 years, with 58.3 % in their second year, and 76.7 % female. Significant differences were found in Body Mechanics Knowledge Form scores across pre-training, post-training, and follow-up assessments. A statistically significant improvement was also observed in Observational Checklist scores, with 95.0 % of students failing the pre-test but all succeeding in the post-training assessment. This study concluded that the occupational injury prevention training program improved the knowledge levels and performance in patient transport practices of paramedic students.

By:McCarty, Catherine A.;Renier, Colleen M.;Conway, Pat G.;+6 moreIn:Critical Care Nursing Quarterly, Jan-Mar2022, volume 45, issue 1, pages 83-87 (5p)CINAHL
The purpose of this project was to develop and evaluate a collaborative nursing/therapist protocol for early mobility in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (MICU) in a regional level II trauma center. Data for patients in the MICU were compared for the periods August 3, 2015-August 2, 2016, and August 3, 2014-August 2, 2015. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 nurses and 1 therapist. Average MICU length of stay decreased from 3.81 to 3.50 days (P = .057). Mean time in mobility chairs did not change (0.12 days vs 0.11 days, P = .389). Mean number of days to first documented level 2-5 activity decreased significantly, from 1.81 to 1.51 days (P = .036). The percentage of hospitalizations with any documented level 3 or 4 activity increased significantly (from 3.8% to 7.4% and from 61.5% to 66.7%, P = .003 and P = .031, respectively). Barriers/challenges to implementation included having enough people to assist, space, documentation, having to coax the physician to place order for upright mobility, availability of therapists for later stages of protocol, patient variability, fear of patient falls, availability of therapy chairs, staff changes, time, and patient refusal. A multidisciplinary approach to protocol development for early mobility in an intensive care unit was successfully implemented at a regional level II trauma center.

By:Gaa, Christyn A.;Akintade, Bimbola F.In:Journal of Doctoral Nursing Practice, 2021, volume 14, issue 2, pages 146-154 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Delirium occurs in as many as 82% of hospitalized patients. Use of a valid and reliable tool allows for early detection and management to mitigate adverse effects, including a decrease in patient falls. Objective: To conduct a quality improvement project to implement the confusion assessment method (CAM) tool in an intermediate care unit and measure delirium screening compliance, feasibility of the tool, and the effect on reported patient falls. Methods: Web-based training using a 14-item pre–post assessment for knowledge comprehension. The CAM tool was added to the electronic health record (EHR), and documentation compliance was measured for eight weeks. Afterwards, a nurse perception survey was distributed, and 60-day pre- and post-intervention patient falls were compared. Results: Forty-seven nurses completed the training. Post-test averages were higher than the pre-test (p =.16); five answers showed significant improvement (p <.02). Screening and documentation compliance were 79.1%. Twenty-one nurses completed the perception survey, demonstrating agreement that delirium CAM screening is a feasible intervention. Patient falls were reduced by 57%. Conclusion: Addition of the CAM tool into the EHR-enhanced screening compliance. Implications for Nursing: Early delirium detection may reduce patient falls. The CAM is a feasible instrument and delirium screening is a worthwhile intervention.

Tools for Preventing Falls in the Surgical Setting by Implementing a Fall Prevention Bundle...American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, 42nd National Conference, April 28 - May 1, 2023, Denver, Colorado.

Preventing Falls in the Surgical Setting by Implementing a Fall Prevention Bundle...American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, 42nd National Conference, April 28 - May 1, 2023, Denver, Colorado.
By:Kelley, Rebecca J.;Gutchell, Veronica;O'Neill, KristineIn:Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing, Aug2023, volume 38, issue 4, page e27CINAHL
A quality improvement (QI) project was implemented to prevent perioperative patient falls. Perioperative adult patients are at a high risk of falls due to gait and balance disturbances, postoperative polypharmacy, intravascular volume status changes, and unfamiliarity with the perioperative environment. There were eight preventable falls during 2020 in adult perioperative patients at an urban hospital despite their current fall prevention strategies. The purpose of this QI project was to evaluate a fall prevention bundle, which included a fall safety agreement, patient falls education, and the Fall Tailoring Interventions for Patient Safety tool (Fall T.I.P.S.). This QI project was implemented in three surgical units over 16 weeks from August to December 2021. Ninety-one registered nurses in Preop/PACU/Phase II recovery, 14 patient care technicians, six transporters, nine patient service representatives, and two administrative assistants were trained on the fall prevention bundle. Preop nurses gave all adult surgical patients the Fall Safety Agreement to review and sign, and implemented the Fall T.I.P.S. tool if the adult surgical patient has a Morse Fall Scale (MFS) score ≥51. Weekly data were collected over 16 weeks, including RN adherence to implementing and documenting interventions, and fall rates. By the end of the project, the average percentage of staff adherence with documentation of interventions was 80.8%. The average percentage of patients who received education and signed the fall safety agreement was 92%. The implementation rate of the Fall T.I.P.S. tool for patients with a MFS ≥51 was an average of 67.1%. The average number of patients with MFS ≥51 was 3.62 patients per day. During project implementation, there were no falls reported. The fall safety agreement provides standardized fall education for patients and can be modified for any setting. The Fall T.I.P.S. tool is an effective communication tool used to notify staff of a patient's fall risk and individualized interventions. There is limited research for fall prevention in perioperative patients. This QI project utilized a fall safety agreement, designed for perioperative patients, and the Fall T.I.P.S. tool to prevent falls. These interventions were simple to implement and had a positive impact on reducing patient falls in the perioperative setting.

A PARTICIPATORY PROGRAM ON FALL PREVENTION IN SURGICAL ONCOLOGY PATIENTS...47th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress, April 27–May 1, 2022, Anaheim, CA
By:Crayton, Kelly;Camunez, Lauren;Duncan, Kellie;+3 moreIn:Oncology Nursing Forum, Mar2022, volume 49, issue 2, pages E18-E19CINAHL
Fall related injuries have increased over time. The rise may be due to an increase in complexity of hospital patient populations. By 2030, the cost of falls is anticipated to be over $100 billion. In August 2020, the Surgical Oncology at a university medical center experienced an increased number of patient falls, resulting in a fall rate of 8.56 patient falls per 1000 patient days. Preliminary review of post fall data revealed that patient falls occurred when patients were toileting or showering, were unwitnessed, or when the patient obtained assistance from a family member. The project goal was to "achieve zero preventable harm" through focus on improving Nurse-Sensitive Quality Indicators. A work group was established to examine patient fall data and develop strategies to reduce patient falls. The team developed a fall prevention bundle and scripting for use when team members educated patients and their families on fall prevention. A validation tool was developed which assessed each nurse's competency to evaluate patients' fall risk, appropriately implement the department's fall prevention bundle, and utilize scripting with patients and families. Nurses' knowledge on fall prevention was rated pre- and post-implementation. Debriefs were implemented post-fall to determine opportunities for preventing future falls. Badge buddy cards with information about the fall prevention bundle and scripting were given to all staff. Signage was placed in patient bathrooms to remind them to call a team member for assistance with toileting. Patient chair alarms were implemented for all high fall risk patients. In December 2020, the patient fall rate decreased to 2.28 falls / 1000 patient days. In January 2021 and February 2021, there were no patient falls. The implementation of a fall prevention bundle, scripting, and skills validation for registered nurses resulted in a decrease of patient fall rates / 1000 patient days. The change in nursing practice aligns with the Nursing Strategic Plan related to achievement of zero preventable harm by focusing on improvement of patient fall rates. A lean process was utilized to identify opportunities and reset expectations. Staff education was accomplished through use of train-the-trainer model. A validation tool was created to decrease variation from patient to patient.

Tools for Exploring nurses' clinical judgment concerning the relative importance of fall risk factors: A mixed method approach using the Q Methodology.

Exploring nurses' clinical judgment concerning the relative importance of fall risk factors: A mixed method approach using the Q Methodology.
By:Takase, Miyuki;Kisanuki, Naomi;Nakayoshi, Yoko;+3 moreIn:International Journal of Nursing Studies, May2024, volume 153, page N.PAGCINAHL
Nurses are pivotal in averting patient falls through their assessment of cues presented by patients and their environments, rendering clinical judgments regarding the risk of falling, and implementing tailored interventions. Despite the intricate cognitive processes entailed in nurses' judgment, no prior studies have explored their approach to assessing the risk of falling. This study aimed to examine how nurses judge the risk of falling among patients with different conditions, whether there are differences in the importance of risk factors as judged by nurses, how they justify their judgments, and what attributes of the nurses influence their judgments. A mixed method approach using the Q Methodology was employed. Three public and private hospitals in Japan. Eighteen nurses participated in the study. Participants were tasked with ranking 36 patient scenarios, each featuring a distinct set of fall risk factors. Subsequently, post-sorting interviews were conducted to gather insights into their typical approach to assessing fall risk and the rationale behind their ranking decisions. A by-person principal component factor extraction was employed to examine differences in the rankings of the scenarios. The interview data were analyzed descriptively to elucidate the reasons behind these discrepancies. Nurses engage in complex cognitive manipulations when evaluating the risk of patient falls, drawing extensively from their wealth of experience while utilizing assessment tools to support their judgments. In essence, nurses identify patients' tendency to act alone without calling a nurse, impaired gait and cognition, sedative use, drains, and limited information sharing among healthcare professionals as key fall risks. In addition, nurses vary in the importance they attribute to certain risk factors, leading to the discrimination of three distinct judgment profiles. One group of nurses judges patients with cognitive impairment and acting alone as high risk. Another group of nurses considers patients with unstable gait and acting alone as high risk. The last group of nurses sees patients wearing slippers as high risk. The post-sorting interviews revealed that their judgments are closely related to the healthcare context and patient population. Nurses operate within diverse contexts, wherein they interact with patients of varying characteristics, collaborate with professionals from diverse disciplines, and have access to varying levels of human and physical resources. This nuanced understanding empowers the formulation of judgments that are finely attuned to the specific context at hand. Not registered.

Tools for Evaluation of a Patient-Centered Fall-Prevention Tool Kit to Reduce Falls and Injuries: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.

Evaluation of a Patient-Centered Fall-Prevention Tool Kit to Reduce Falls and Injuries: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
By:Dykes, Patricia C.;Burns, Zoe;Adelman, Jason;+9 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 11/17/2020, volume 3, issue 11, page e2025889CINAHL
This nonrandomized controlled trial assesses whether implementation of a nurse-led, patient-centered tool kit for fall prevention was associated with a reduction in rates of falls and fall-related injuries in 3 academic medical centers in Boston and New York City. Key Points: Question: Is a fall-prevention tool kit that engages patients and families associated with a reduction in falls? Findings: In this nonrandomized controlled trial including 37 231 patients from 14 medical units within 3 academic medical centers, an interrupted time series found that implementation of a fall-prevention tool kit was associated with a statistically significant 15% reduction in overall inpatient falls and a 34% reduction in injurious falls. Meaning: The findings suggest that tools to support patient engagement throughout hospitalization in the fall-prevention process may be associated with a reduction in falls and fall-related injuries. Importance: Falls represent a leading cause of preventable injury in hospitals and a frequently reported serious adverse event. Hospitalization is associated with an increased risk for falls and serious injuries including hip fractures, subdural hematomas, or even death. Multifactorial strategies have been shown to reduce falls in acute care hospitals, but evidence for fall-related injury prevention in hospitals is lacking. Objective: To assess whether a fall-prevention tool kit that engages patients and families in the fall-prevention process throughout hospitalization is associated with reduced falls and injurious falls. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nonrandomized controlled trial using stepped wedge design was conducted between November 1, 2015, and October 31, 2018, in 14 medical units within 3 academic medical centers in Boston and New York City. All adult inpatients hospitalized in participating units were included in the analysis. Interventions: A nurse-led fall-prevention tool kit linking evidence-based preventive interventions to patient-specific fall risk factors and designed to integrate continuous patient and family engagement in the fall-prevention process. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of patient falls per 1000 patient-days in targeted units during the study period. The secondary outcome was the rate of falls with injury per 1000 patient-days. Results: During the interrupted time series, 37 231 patients were evaluated, including 17 948 before the intervention (mean [SD] age, 60.56 [18.30] years; 9723 [54.17%] women) and 19 283 after the intervention (mean [SD] age, 60.92 [18.10] years; 10 325 [53.54%] women). There was an overall adjusted 15% reduction in falls after implementation of the fall-prevention tool kit compared with before implementation (2.92 vs 2.49 falls per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 2.06-3.00 falls per 1000 patient-days]; adjusted rate ratio 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96; P =.01) and an adjusted 34% reduction in injurious falls (0.73 vs 0.48 injurious falls per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 0.34-0.70 injurious falls per 1000 patient-days]; adjusted rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88; P =.003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this nonrandomized controlled trial, implementation of a fall-prevention tool kit was associated with a significant reduction in falls and related injuries. A patient–care team partnership appears to be beneficial for prevention of falls and fall-related injuries. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02969343

Falls, defined as unplanned descents to the floor with or without injury to an individual, remain to be one of the most challenging health conditions. Fall rate is a key quality metric of acute care hospitals, rehabilitation settings, and long-term care facilities. Fall prevention policies with proper implementation have been the focus of surveys by regulatory bodies, including The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for all healthcare settings. Since October 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stopped reimbursing hospitals for the costs related to patient falls, shifting the accountability for fall prevention to the healthcare providers. Research shows that almost one-third of falls can be prevented and extensive fall prevention interventions exist. Recently, technology-based applications have been introduced in healthcare to obtain superior patient care outcomes and experience via efficiency, access, and reliability. Several areas in fall prevention deploy technology, including predictive and prescriptive analytics using big data, video monitoring and alarm technology, wearable sensors, exergame and virtual reality, robotics in home environment assessment, and personal coaching. This review discusses an overview of these technology-based applications in various settings, focusing on the outcomes of fall reductions, cost, and other benefits.

Tools for AUDITING: DOES IT INCREASE FALL COMPLIANCE?...47th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress, April 27–May 1, 2022, Anaheim, CA

AUDITING: DOES IT INCREASE FALL COMPLIANCE?...47th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress, April 27–May 1, 2022, Anaheim, CA
By:Williams, Carly;Beaver, Clara;Cook, CatherineIn:Oncology Nursing Forum, Mar2022, volume 49, issue 2, page 33 (1p)CINAHL
Research has shown that compliance to universal fall protocols can reduce the incidence of falls for the inpatient population. The oncology population is at an increased risk for falls and falls with injuries, making adherence to fall precautions among this population especially crucial to patient safety. In 2020, there was an increase in patient falls and falls with injury at Karmanos Cancer Institute. This came after implementation of new fall protocols the previous year which resulted in a significant decrease in falls during 2019. The purpose of this project was to determine if auditing the compliance of fall prevention protocols would increase nurse compliance and decrease the number of patient falls. An audit tool which included all portions of the fall prevention protocol was developed to assess staff compliance with the protocol. The tool included use of a fall safety checklist, documentation of fall safety education, the use of a bed alarm, and presence of all fall safety equipment. Audits were performed weekly on acute care units for patients with a Schmid score of 3 or greater. The audits were completed at various times throughout the day to capture compliance among each shift. Registered nurses were notified of noncompliance in real time, at which point appropriate prevention measures were implemented. The audit data was distributed to leadership for review of compliance and to follow up with staff. Fall rates among inpatients at Karmanos continue to fluctuate as well as compliance with the fall protocol. Leadership noticed that consistent completion of audits correlated with increased compliance to fall protocols and increased staff awareness. After initiation of the fall audits staff members have reported increased active awareness of fall prevention protocols. Due to underlying physiological factors the oncology population is at an increased risk for falls which could result in injury. Fall audits can be an effective way to monitor staff compliance and identify areas of opportunity in a unit's fall prevention strategies. Compliance to safety protocols has been shown to increase with regular auditing and feedback.

Tools for Budgetary investment in evidence‐based practice by chief nurses and stronger EBP cultures are associated with less turnover and better patient outcomes.

Budgetary investment in evidence‐based practice by chief nurses and stronger EBP cultures are associated with less turnover and better patient outcomes.
By:Melnyk, Bernadette Mazurek;Hsieh, Andreanna Pavan;Messinger, Jeffery;+3 moreIn:Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Apr2023, volume 20, issue 2, pages 162-171 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Hospitals and healthcare systems strive to meet benchmarks for the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicator (NDNQI) measures, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Core Measures, and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) outcome indicators. Prior research indicates that Chief Nursing Officers and Executives (CNOs, CNEs) believe that evidence‐based practice (EBP) is important for ensuring the quality of care, but they allocate little funding to its implementation and report it as a low priority in their healthcare system. It is not known how EBP budget investment by chief nurses affects NDNQI, CMS Core Measures, and HCAHPS indicators or key EBP attributes and nurse outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to generate evidence on the relationships among the budget devoted to EBP by chief nurses and its impact on key patient and nurse outcomes along with EBP attributes. Methods: A descriptive correlational design was used. An online survey was sent to CNO and CNE members (N = 5026) of various national and regional nurse leader professional organizations across the United States in two recruitment rounds. Data collected included CNO/CNE EBP Beliefs, EBP Implementation, and perceived organizational culture of EBP; organizational culture, structure, personnel, and resources for EBP; percent of budget dedicated to EBP; key performance measures (NDNQI, CMS Core Measures, HCAHPS); nurse satisfaction; nurse turnover; and demographic questions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics. Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients were calculated among EBP budget, nursing outcome measures, and EBP measures. Results: One hundred and fifteen CNEs/CNOs completed the survey (a 2.3% response rate). The majority (60.9%) allocated <5% of their budget to EBP, with a third investing none. An increase in EBP budget was associated with fewer patient falls and trauma, less nursing turnover, and stronger EBP culture and other positive EBP attributes. A greater number of EBP projects were also associated with better patient outcomes. Linking Evidence to Action: Chief nurse executives and CNOs allocate very little of their budgets to EBP. When CNEs and CNOs invest more in EBP, patient, nursing, and EBP outcomes improve. System‐wide implementation of EBP, which includes appropriate EBP budget allocation, is necessary for improvements in hospital quality indicators and nursing turnover.

Tools for Community Health Systems' Ongoing Journey to Zero Preventable Harm.

Community Health Systems' Ongoing Journey to Zero Preventable Harm.
By:Simon, Lynn T.;Van Buren, TerrieIn:NEJM Catalyst Innovations in Care Delivery, Dec2023, volume 4, issue 12, page 5 (1p)CINAHL
Community Health Systems (CHS) has established patient safety as a core value. Through the deployment of specific high-reliability leadership methods, human error prevention behaviors, and a structured approach to cause analysis, CHS has achieved an 89% serious safety event rate reduction since implementing these processes in 2013. Specifically, there have been reductions in serious harm events related to medication errors, patient falls, care management, health care-associated infections, and procedural events such as retained foreign objects. Early on, CHS developed a patient safety organization that oversees the high-reliability organization journey of the CHS. The process is an integrated approach that incorporates data standardization, technology, cause analysis, and other programs that effectively and consistently keep patient harm and safety efforts top of mind among staff, frontline leaders, and executive leaders.

Tools for Influence of nurse managers' toxic leadership behaviours on nurse‐reported adverse events and quality of care.

Influence of nurse managers' toxic leadership behaviours on nurse‐reported adverse events and quality of care.
By:Labrague, Leodoro J.In:Journal of Nursing Management, May2021, volume 29, issue 4, pages 855-863 (9p)CINAHL
Aim: To assess the impact of toxic leadership behaviours among nurse managers on nurse‐reported adverse events and quality of care. Background: Toxic leadership, a form of ineffective leadership, is increasingly becoming rampant in the field of nursing and has been strongly linked to poor nurse job outcomes including job dissatisfaction, higher stress levels, and increased turnover intention. To date, no studies have been conducted to examine how this type of leadership behaviours affects patient outcomes and care quality. Methods: A multicentre, cross‐sectional study. This study involved a sample of 1,053 registered nurses working in 20 hospitals in the Philippines. Three standardized scales were deployed, including the Toxic Leadership Behaviors of Nurse Managers Scale, the Adverse Patient Events Scale and the single‐item quality‐of‐care‐measure. Results: Overall, nurses (96.2%) appraised the quality of care of their respective units as 'good to excellent' and cited complaints from patients and their families as the most commonly reported adverse events. Toxic leadership behaviours in nurse managers were strongly associated with increased nurse‐reported adverse events including reports of complaints (β =.619; p <.001) and verbal mistreatment from patients and their families (β =.407; p <.001), patient falls (β =.834; p <.001), health care–associated infections (β =.629; p <.001) and errors in administering medication (β =.708; p <.001) and with decreased quality of care (β = −.216; p <.001). Conclusion: Nurses who experience working under a nurse manager exhibiting toxic behaviours reported an increased frequency of nurse‐reported adverse events and poorer quality of care in the unit. Implications for Nursing Management: Organizational measure to reduce the occurrence of adverse events and enhance the quality of care provided in medical units may include intervention to develop positive leadership practices among nurse managers.

Tools for Nurses' knowledge, attitude, and fall prevention practices at south Korean hospitals: a cross-sectional survey.

Nurses' knowledge, attitude, and fall prevention practices at south Korean hospitals: a cross-sectional survey.
By:Cho, Mi-young;Jang, Sun JooIn:BMC Nursing, 11/24/2020, volume 19, issue 1, page N.PAGCINAHL
Background: Fall-prevention activities are nursing interventions which are designed to improve patient safety. The introduction of evaluations of medical institutions and an increase in medical litigation has led institutions to emphasize the importance of fall-prevention activities. The current situation regarding falls among patients in small and medium-sized hospitals is poorly understood. This study assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding falls, and fall-prevention activities of nurses working in small- and medium-sized hospitals. Methods: Nurses (N = 162) from seven small- and medium-sized hospitals participated in the study. Data on participants' characteristics, education regarding patient falls, knowledge of stretcher cart use, attitudes regarding patient falls, and fall-prevention activities were collected from August 1 to September 1, 2016. Results: Nurses' knowledge of patient falls was positively correlated with their experience with inpatient falls. Furthermore, nurses' attitudes regarding falls were influenced by their nursing experience and fall prevention education. Attitudes positively correlated with fall-prevention activities, but knowledge did not. Nurses' attitudes regarding patient falls were correlated with fall-prevention activities. Conclusion: Hospitals should develop incentive programs to improve nurses' attitudes which are based on their subjective norms and tailored to each hospital's specific circumstances to ensure engagement in fall prevention activities. In short, we recommend that consistent, repeated, and custom fall-prevention education should be implemented in small- and medium-sized hospitals to promote engagement in fall-prevention activities. Patient safety activities in small- and medium-sized hospitals can be enhanced by creating an environment that encourages active and self-directed participation in developing fall-prevention strategies using motivation and rewards.

Tools for Purposeful Hourly Rounding to Decrease Peripheral Intravenous Infiltrations and Extravasations in Pediatrics.

Purposeful Hourly Rounding to Decrease Peripheral Intravenous Infiltrations and Extravasations in Pediatrics.
By:Garcia, Mayra G.;Dutton, Hayden;Samuel, Kiele;+1 moreIn:Journal of Pediatric Nursing, Nov2021, volume 61, pages 59-66 (8p)CINAHL
Pediatric patients are at high risk for peripheral intravenous infiltrations and extravasations (PIVIE) resulting in patient harm. Structured hourly rounding has demonstrated to improve quality outcomes. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to implement structured hourly rounding to decrease the median rate of moderate PIVIE rates from 3.13 to 2.58 per thousand patient days over a 6-month time period in pediatric patients with infusing continuous IV fluids. A pilot was conducted to hardwire hourly assessments for peripheral intravenous lines (PIV) in pediatric patients with continuous fluids utilizing a structured hourly rounding process. Bedside nurses utilized the P.A.T.H. model to assess pain management (P), assess PIVs for early PIVIE recognition (A), address things patient and family may need (T), and reduce the occurrence in hospital acquired conditions (H). Data was collected on unit nurse sensitive indicators and compliance to hourly rounding. Structured hourly rounding using the P.A.T.H. model successfully hardwired hourly PIV assessments. The unit reduced their median moderate PIVIE rate to 1.83 per thousand patient days, an 41% improvement. The pilot also had positive unintended consequences of improved pain reassessment from 67% to 100%, increased patient satisfaction scores of 67% to 97% and reduced patient falls by 29%. Structured hourly rounding using the P.A.T.H. model can positively hardwire hourly PIV assessments in pediatric patients. Sustainability of hourly rounding requires leadership support and nursing commitment to impact quality metrics. Organizations should consider implementing focused hourly rounding to address PIVIEs.

Tools for Identification of Quality Indicator Codes Associated With Falls in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities.

Identification of Quality Indicator Codes Associated With Falls in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities.
By:Wright, Jonathan;D'Ausilio, Jamie;Holmberg, Janene;+4 moreIn:Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Mar2022, volume 103, issue 3, page e31CINAHL
To investigate if quality indicator (QI) codes are associated with patient falls in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). In this retrospective cohort study, we collected data from the medical records of 1700 patients. With the authorization of an institutional review board, we extracted data from 4 Utah IRFs. We included the medical records of all patients over 14 years of age who were admitted and discharged from these facilities in 2020. All patients were discharged prior to data extraction, so no interventions beyond standard care were delivered. Items extracted include age, sex, race/ethnicity, diagnosis, fall status, Morse Fall Scale score, and QI codes for understanding, self-care, and mobility performance. We calculated means, standard deviations, confidence intervals, and statistical differences between those who fell and those who did not. We explored associations between QI codes and falls using multivariaable logistic regression analysis. Medical records revealed 97 (5.71%) patients fell during IRF admission. Quality indicator codes for patient understanding, self-care, and mobility performance were significantly different between patients who fell and those who did not. A multivariable logistic regression model showed that low performance with understanding, walking 10 feet, and toileting was significantly associated with falls. Having an admission QI code below 4 for understanding increased patients' odds of falling by an estimated 78%. Admission QI codes below 3 for walking 10 feet and toileting indicated over 2 times greater odds of falling. Diagnosis, age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not significantly associated with falls. Quality indicator codes for understanding, self-care, and mobility are significantly associated with falls. Further research should explore how these required codes may be used to identify patients likely to fall during admission. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

By:Aydemir, Azize;Koç, ZelihaIn:Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, Mar2023, volume 29, issue 3, pages 195-204 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Nurses have a key role in ensuring the safety of patients, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving patient outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to determine the factors affecting patient safety, with a focus on the culture and attitudes of nurses working in emergency units. Method: This cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted between 10 January and 30 August 2015 among 282 nurses who worked at emergency units of 19 hospitals in the north-central Black Sea Region of Türkiye Data were obtained using descriptive information forms, the Patient Safety Attitude Scale (PSAS) and the Patient Safety Culture Scale (PSCS). Results: The mean total PSAS score was 152.26 [standard deviation (SD) 22.54; range 46--230], while the mean total PSCS score was 2.56 (SD 0.52; range 1--4). Around a quarter of the participants reported errors, such as medication errors and patient falls, which threatened patient safety in the emergency units. The case report forms were not filled when these errors occurred. Conclusion: Attitude and culture of nurses in hospital emergency units towards patient safety differed according to their sociodemographic and work--life characteristics, including being satisfied with working in the emergency room, quality of work--life balance, level of job satisfaction, and number of years working in the emergency room.

Typology, Severity, and Outcomes of Adverse Events Related to Angiographic Equipment—A Ten-Year Analysis of the FDA MAUDE Database.
By:Healy, Gerard M.;Ahrari, Aida;Alkhalifah, Fahd;+4 moreIn:Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal, Nov2023, volume 74, issue 4, pages 737-744 (8p)CINAHL
Purpose: Angiographic equipment is a key component of healthcare infrastructure, used for endovascular procedures throughout the body. The literature on adverse events related to this technology is limited. The purpose of this study was to analyze adverse events related to angiographic devices from the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Methods: MAUDE data on angiographic imaging equipment from July 2011 to July 2021 were extracted. Qualitative content analysis was performed, a typology of adverse events was derived, and this was used to classify the data. Outcomes were assessed using the Healthcare Performance Improvement (HPI) and Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) adverse event classifications. Results: There were 651 adverse events reported. Most were near misses (67%), followed by precursor safety events (20.5%), serious safety events (11.2%), and unclassifiable (1.2%). Events impacted patients (42.1%), staff (3.2%), both (1.2%), or neither (53.5%). The most common events associated with patient harm were intra-procedure system shut down, foot pedal malfunction, table movement malfunction, image quality deterioration, patient falls, and fluid damage to system. Overall, 34 (5.2%) events were associated with patient death; 18 during the procedure and 5 during patient transport to another angiographic suite/hospital due to critical failure of equipment. Conclusion: Adverse events related to angiographic equipment are rare; however, serious adverse events and deaths have been reported. This study has defined a typology of the most common adverse events associated with patient and staff harm. Increased understanding of these failures may lead to improved product design, user training, and departmental contingency planning. Visual Abstract

Tools for Nurse Burnout and Patient Safety, Satisfaction, and Quality of Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Nurse Burnout and Patient Safety, Satisfaction, and Quality of Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
By:Li, Lambert Zixin;Yang, Peilin;Singer, Sara J.;+3 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 05/11/2024, volume 7, issue 11, page e2443059CINAHL
Key Points: Question: What are the magnitude and moderators of the association between nurse burnout and health care quality and safety? Findings: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 85 studies including 288 581 nurses, nurse burnout was associated with a lower patient safety climate and patient safety grade; more nosocomial infections, patient falls, medication errors, and adverse events; lower patient satisfaction ratings; and lower nurse-assessed quality of care. The associations were consistent across nurse age, sex, work experience, and geography. Meaning: These findings suggest that systems-level interventions for nurse burnout may improve patient outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the magnitude and moderators of the association between nurse burnout and patient safety, patient satisfaction, and quality of care. Importance: Occupational burnout syndrome is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment and is prevalent among nurses. Although previous meta-analyses have explored the correlates of nurse burnout, none have estimated their association with health care quality and safety and patient morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate the magnitude and moderators of the association between nurse burnout and patient safety, patient satisfaction, and quality of care. Data Source: The Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases were searched from January 1, 1994, to February 29, 2024. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently identified studies that reported a quantifiable association between nurse burnout and any of the outcomes of patient safety, patient satisfaction, or quality of health care. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The PRISMA 2020 guideline was followed. Two reviewers independently extracted the standardized mean difference (SMD) (Cohen d) estimates for a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were conducted using prespecified variables. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any measure of patient safety, patient satisfaction, or quality of health care previously associated with nurse burnout. Results: A total of 85 studies (81 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal) involving 288 581 nurses from 32 countries (mean [SD] age, 33.9 (2.1) years; 82.7% female; mean [SD] burnout prevalence rate with study-specific ascertainments, 30.7% [9.7%]) were included. Nurse burnout was associated with a lower safety climate or culture (SMD, −0.68; 95% CI, −0.83 to −0.54), lower safety grade (SMD, −0.53; 95% CI, −0.72 to −0.34), and more frequent nosocomial infections (SMD, −0.20; 95% CI, −0.36 to −0.04), patient falls (SMD, −0.12; 95% CI, −0.22 to −0.03), medication errors (SMD, −0.30; 95% CI, −0.48 to −0.11), adverse events or patient safety incidents (SMD, −0.42; 95% CI, −0.76 to −0.07), and missed care or care left undone (SMD, −0.58; 95% CI, −0.91 to −0.26) but not with the frequency of pressure ulcers. Nurse burnout was also associated with lower patient satisfaction ratings (SMD, −0.51; 95% CI, −0.86 to −0.17) but not with the frequencies of patient complaints or patient abuse. Finally, nurse burnout was associated with lower nurse-assessed quality of care (SMD, −0.44; 95% CI, −0.57 to −0.30) but not with standardized mortality rate. The associations were consistent across nurses' age, sex, work experience, and geography and persistent over time. For patient safety outcomes, the association was smaller for the low personal accomplishment subcomponent of burnout than for emotional exhaustion or depersonalization, as well as for nurses with a college education. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, nurse burnout was found to be associated with lower health care quality and safety and lower patient satisfaction. This association was consistent across nurse and study characteristics.

Tools for The Effectiveness of the Joint Commission International Accreditation in Improving Quality at King Fahd University Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A Mixed Methods Approach.

The Effectiveness of the Joint Commission International Accreditation in Improving Quality at King Fahd University Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A Mixed Methods Approach.
By:Shawan, Deema AlIn:Journal of Healthcare Leadership, Feb2021, volume 13, pages 47-61 (15p)CINAHL
Introduction: Saudi Arabia has one of the highest numbers of health organizations accredited by the Joint Commission International. This study aimed to measure this process's effectiveness in improving quality at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the study investigated health providers' perceptions of this process. Materials and Methods: This research utilized a convergent parallel mixed method. For the quantitative analysis, an interrupted time series was conducted to assess the changes in a total of 12 quality outcomes pre- and post-accreditation. Thematic analysis was utilized to collect and analyze qualitative data from hospital employees and health providers. Results: The quantitative results indicated that pursuing accreditation positively impacted nine out of 12 outcomes. The improved outcomes included: the average length of stay, the percentage of hand hygiene compliance, the rate of nosocomial infections, the percentage of radiology reporting outliers, the rate of pressure ulcers, the percentage of the correct identification of patients, the percentage of critical lab reporting, and the bed occupancy rate. The outcomes that did not improve were the rate of patients leaving the ER without being seen, the percentage of OR cancelations, and the rate of patient falls. The qualitative analysis suggested that the accreditation process was perceived positively by participants. Nevertheless, participants also highlighted some of the drawbacks of this process, including: the potential bias in observation-based key performance indicators, the focus on improving process without enhancing the hospital structure, and the increased workload. Conclusion: International accreditation had a positive impact on quality and was received positively by providers. However, several issues need to be addressed by hospital administrators in future accreditation cycles. According to participants, the most notable issue during the first two accreditation cycles was the increased workload and paperwork, which can potentially distract from patient care.

Tools for Using Simulation to Develop Clinical Reasoning Skills for Registered Practical Nurses New to Acute Care.

Using Simulation to Develop Clinical Reasoning Skills for Registered Practical Nurses New to Acute Care.
By:Dale-Tam, Jennifer;Dale, LeahIn:Clinical Simulation in Nursing, Jan2024, volume 86, page N.PAGCINAHL
• Simulation based education developed the foundations of clinical reasoning in registered practical nurses (RPNs) new to acute care. • Simulation based education for RPNs contributed to decreased number of patient falls and activation of the emergency response team on units where the role was newly implemented. • RPNs felt confident and empowered to practice in acute medicine and inpatient surgical units after participating in a simulation-based education session. To address the nursing workforce shortage, registered practical nurses (RPNs) were introduced to acute care areas at The Ottawa Hospital. The Kirkpatrick levels were used to evaluate the RPN simulation-based education session. A paired T-test was used to assess statistical significance of patient safety data. Greater than 81% of RPNs found the simulations to be extremely effective at preparing them for their new role. Patient safety data showed a statistically significant decrease in rapid-response team calls (p =.0431) and a decrease in patient falls that was not quite statistically significant (p =.0506). Through the simulation sessions, the RPNs mastered the fundamentals of being able to assess, construct, implement, and evaluate a plan of patient care, setting the framework for clinical reasoning.

Background: Fostering a healthy work environment becomes a necessity in health care institutions that value quality care and patient safety. However, limited studies investigated the impact of work environment characteristics including staffing and teamness among healthcare teams on adverse patient events in Oman. Aims: To examine the (1) impact of work environment, interprofessional teamness, staffing levels on adverse patient events and (2) predicting factors of perceptions of work environment among nurses in the Sultanate of Oman. Method: A cross‐sectional descriptive design was utilized to collect data from 2113 nurses. Participants completed a self‐report questionnaire that included a set of instruments. Results: The results showed a strong positive relationship between work environment and teamness (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). Nurses working in a favorable environment that has positive teamwork reported a reduction in adverse events including patient and family complaints, patient and family verbal abuse, patient falls, nosocomial infections, and medication errors (p < 0.001). There was a nonsignificant correlation between staffing and adverse patient events. Conclusion: Fostering a healthy and supportive work environment continue to be crucial for ensuring patient safety. Nurse administrators should strive to improve work environment through creating a culture that values interprofessional teamwork and collaborative relationships.

Tools for Challenges and Opportunities of Patient Safety Event Reporting.

Challenges and Opportunities of Patient Safety Event Reporting.
By:Yang GONGIn:Studies in Health Technology & Informatics, 2022, volume 291, pages 133-150 (18p)CINAHL
he World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first-ever World Patient Safety Day on September 17, 2019, which remarks a global campaign to create an awareness of patient safety and urges people to show their commitment to making healthcare safer. Reporting medical incidents or patient safety events (PSE) has been recommended as an effective approach for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. It is believed that PSE reporting systems (e-reporting) could be a good resource to share and to learn from the reporting if the event data are collected in a properly structured format. Unfortunately, the prevalence of underreporting and low quality of the reports have become barriers to ultimately achieve the goal of preventing and reducing medical incidents. This chapter describes the efforts that have been made to improve e- reporting through informatics approaches, including a review of PSE taxonomies and conceptual frameworks, studies of medication events, patient falls, and PSE involved in health information technologies, as well as discussions of design requirements for future e-reporting systems.

Tools for Professional autonomy among nurses in Saudi Arabian critical care units.

Professional autonomy among nurses in Saudi Arabian critical care units.
By:Alruwaili, Majed M.;Abuadas, Fuad H.In:BMC Nursing, 06/29/2023, volume 22, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Professional autonomy is essential in expanding the scope of nursing practice and has been recognized as a top nursing priority. Objective: This study aims to assess Saudi nurses' autonomy level in critical care settings and examine the influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on their autonomy level. Methods: A correlational design and a convenience sampling approach were used to recruit 212 staff nurses from five Saudi governmental hospitals in Jouf region of Saudi Arabia. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire composed of two sections, including sociodemographic characteristics and the Belgen autonomy scale. The Belgen autonomy scale used in this study measures nurses' autonomy levels and consists of 42 items rated on an ordinal scale. The scale's minimum score of 1 indicates nurses with no authority, while the maximum score of 5 indicates nurses with full authority. Results: Descriptive statistics revealed that nurses in the sample had a moderate overall work autonomy (M = 3.08), with higher autonomy in patient care decisions (M = 3.25) compared to unit operations decisions (M = 2.91). Nurses had the highest level of autonomy in tasks related to preventing patient falls (M = 3.84), preventing skin breakdown (M = 3.69), and promoting health activities (M = 3.62), while they had the lowest level of autonomy in ordering diagnostic tests (M = 2.27), determining the day of discharge (M = 2.61), and planning the unit's annual budget (M = 2.22). The multiple linear regression model (R2 = 0.32, F (16, 195) = 5.87, p <.001) showed that education level and years of experience in critical care settings were significantly related to nurses' work autonomy. Conclusion: Saudi nurses in acute care settings have moderate professional autonomy, with higher autonomy in making patient care decisions than unit operations decisions. Investing in nurses' education and training could increase their professional autonomy, leading to improved patient care. Policymakers and nursing administrators can use the study's results to develop strategies that promote nurses' professional development and autonomy.

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine changes in healthcare practitioners' perception of supportiveness of their physical work environment, and trend in patient fall, when moving from a centralized to a decentralized unit configuration. Background: Previous studies on decentralization have not uniformly provided findings consistent with desired outcome. Method: A pretest–posttest study was conducted in an elective surgery medical-surgical unit in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The independent variable was the physical design supporting centralized versus decentralized nursing models. Data were collected from healthcare staff with a self-report survey "before" (September 2017; n = 42) and "after" (June 2019; n = 22), and interviews. Before–after data were analyzed using both parametric and nonparametric tests to identify significant differences. Qualitative responses were analyzed to identify triangulating evidences. Monthly patient fall data were collected for a 3-year period and analyzed using log-linear Poisson Regression model. Results: Results show favorable assessments in the areas of overall supportiveness of design, equipment and soiled utility location, peer support, process flow visualization, and overall satisfaction. A reduction in patient falls was observed. Unfavorable outcomes were found in the contexts of walking distance, multidisciplinary collaboration, alarm audibility, nurse station size, and PPE location. Conclusions: This study underscores that the success of a unit cannot be achieved without coordinated and successful interventions in the areas of operations, processes, policies, culture, and the physical design.

Tools for Multilevel factors influencing falls of older patients in hospital: The risk of hospital-induced delirium and the impact of nurse staffing.

Multilevel factors influencing falls of older patients in hospital: The risk of hospital-induced delirium and the impact of nurse staffing.
By:Kim, Jinhyun;Lee, Eunhee;Lee, SunmiIn:Geriatric Nursing, Jan2025, volume 61, pages 13-19 (7p)CINAHL
• Factors such as advanced age, the administration of multiple medications and treatments, mobility limitations, and hospital-induced delirium were identified as determinants of in-patient falls. • The occurrence of hospital-induced delirium in older patients is identified as the most significant contributor to the elevated risk of falls during their hospital stay. • Adequate nurse staffing emerges as a crucial factor in diminishing the risk of falls in older patients who exhibit predisposing risk factors. This study aimed to explore the individual and organizational factors influencing falls among older inpatients, with a particular focus on the risk posed by hospital-induced delirium and the effect of nurse staffing levels. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a national healthcare database to examine falls in hospitalized older adults, applying a mixed-effect logistic regression model Data from 391,902 patients across 580 hospitals revealed that 1.2 % of older inpatients experienced falls. Influential factors for falls included advanced age, the use of multiple medications and treatments, impaired mobility, and hospital-induced delirium. Nurse staffing levels markedly influenced the reduction of fall risks among older patients. Falls among hospitalized older adults are a frequent consequence of multifaceted risk components, highlighting the need for comprehensive fall prevention strategies and adequate.

Tools for Implementation of the UMove Mobility Program to Promote Safe Patient Mobility and Reduce Falls in the Hospital Setting.

Implementation of the UMove Mobility Program to Promote Safe Patient Mobility and Reduce Falls in the Hospital Setting.
By:Wells, Chris L.;Resnick, Barbara;McPherson, Rachel;+1 moreIn:Research in Gerontological Nursing, 2024, volume 17, issue 1, pages 19-29 (11p)CINAHL
The purpose of the current quality improvement (QI) project was to implement the UMove Early Mobility Program to engage patients in safe out of bed (OOB) activities and reduce falls, specifically focusing on toileting-related falls, during the hospital stay. Eight nursing units implemented the UMove program, including the UMove Mobility Screen (UMove MS), to select strategies to reduce toileting-related falls while increasing mobility. De-identified, unit-based data were collected from hospital reports. Nursing had a 95% documentation compliance rate for the UMove MS, and OOB activities and ambulation were documented at 50% and 57%, respectively. There was no statistical difference found in reducing toileting-related falls or sustaining increased OOB activities across the 15-month QI project. Toileting-related falls approached significance with a rate reduction from 1.77 pre-implementation to 0.23 at 6 months and no toileting-related falls at 12 months. Despite no significant findings, there is evidence that clinical changes occurred with nurses assessing and promoting mobility, while implementing strategies to reduce toileting-related falls.

Tools for Implementing a multidisciplinary rapid geriatric observation unit for non-critical older patients referred to hospital: observational study on real-world data.

Implementing a multidisciplinary rapid geriatric observation unit for non-critical older patients referred to hospital: observational study on real-world data.
By:Nouvenne, Antonio;Ticinesi, Andrea;Cerundolo, Nicoletta;+8 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, Mar2022, volume 34, issue 3, pages 599-609 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Geriatric rapid observation units may represent an alternative to hospitalization in older patients with non-critical acute illness. Aims: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to a geriatric observation unit called URGe (Unità Geriatrica Rapida), implemented in an Italian hospital and characterized by multidisciplinary medical staff with geriatric expertise, fast-track access to diagnostic resources, regular use of point-of-care ultrasound and predicted length of stay (LOS) < 72 h. Methods: The medical records of patients admitted to URGe during a 3-month period (452 subjects, 247 F and 205 M, median age 82 years, IQR 77–87) were retrospectively examined. The primary study endpoint was transferral from URGe to regular wards. Baseline covariates included demographics, comprehensive geriatric assessment, acute illnesses, comorbidities, vital signs and routine laboratory tests. Results: Despite elevated burden of multimorbidity (median number of chronic diseases 4, IQR 2–5) and frailty (median Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale score 4, IQR 3–6), only 137 patients (30.3%) required transferral from URGe to regular wards. The main factors positively associated with this outcome were Rockwood score, fever, cancer and red cell distribution width (P < 0.05 on multivariate logistic regression model). The rate of complications (mortality, delirium, and falls) during URGe stay was low (0.5%, 7% and 2%, respectively). Overall duration of hospital stay was lower than that of a group of historical controls matched by age, sex, main diagnosis, multimorbidity and frailty. Conclusions: The URGe model of acute geriatric care is feasible, safe and has the potential of reducing unnecessary hospitalizations of older patients.

Tools for Association of a Perioperative Multicomponent Fall Prevention Intervention With Falls and Quality of Life After Elective Inpatient Surgical Procedures.

Association of a Perioperative Multicomponent Fall Prevention Intervention With Falls and Quality of Life After Elective Inpatient Surgical Procedures.
By:Fritz, Bradley A.;King, Christopher R.;Mehta, Divya;+7 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 11/03/2022, volume 5, issue 3, page e221938CINAHL
Key Points: Question: Is an intervention that incorporates patient education, home medication review, and hazard identification in the home environment associated with reductions in falls during the first year after an elective inpatient surgical procedure? Findings: In this cohort study involving 1396 patients (698 pairs) presenting for elective inpatient surgical procedures, 33% of patients in the intervention group and 32% of patients in the control group experienced a fall within 1 year after undergoing a surgical procedure, representing a nonsignificant difference. Meaning: These results suggest that other interventions may need to be developed to reduce postoperative fall incidence among patients receiving elective inpatient surgical procedures. Importance: Falls after elective inpatient surgical procedures are common and have physical, emotional, and financial consequences. Close interactions between patients and health care teams before and after surgical procedures may offer opportunities to address modifiable risk factors associated with falls. Objective: To assess whether a multicomponent intervention that incorporates education, home medication review, and home safety assessment is associated with reductions in the incidence of falls after elective inpatient surgical procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective propensity score–matched cohort study was a prespecified secondary analysis of data from the Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted at a single academic medical center between January 16, 2015, and May 7, 2018. Patients in the intervention group of the present study were enrolled in either arm of the ENGAGES clinical trial. Patients in the control group were selected from the Systematic Assessment and Targeted Improvement of Services Following Yearly Surgical Outcomes Surveys prospective observational cohort study, which created a registry of patient-reported postoperative outcomes at the same single center. The propensity score–matched cohort in the present study included 1396 patients (698 pairs) selected from a pool of 2013 eligible patients. All patients underwent elective surgical procedures with general anesthesia and had a hospital stay of 2 or more days. Data were analyzed from January 2, 2020, to January 11, 2022. Interventions: The multicomponent safety intervention (offered to all patients in the ENGAGES clinical trial) included patient education on fall prevention techniques, home medication review by a geriatric psychiatrist (with communication of recommended changes to the surgeon), a self-administered home safety assessment, and targeted occupational therapy home visits with home hazard removal (offered to patients with a preoperative history of falls). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was patient-reported falls within 1 year after an elective inpatient surgical procedure. The secondary outcome was quality of life 1 year after an elective surgical procedure, which was measured using the physical and mental composite summary scores on the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (score range, 0-100 points, with 0 indicating lowest quality of life and 100 indicating highest quality of life). Results: Among 1396 patients, the median age was 69 years (IQR, 64-75 years), and 739 patients (52.9%) were male. With regard to race, 5 patients (0.4%) were Asian, 97 (6.9%) were Black or African American, 2 (0.1%) were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 1237 (88.6%) were White, 3 (0.2%) were of other race, and 52 (3.7%) were of unknown race; with regard to ethnicity, 12 patients (0.9%) were Hispanic or Latino, 1335 (95.6%) were non-Hispanic or non-Latino, and 49 (3.5%) were of unknown ethnicity. Adherence to individual intervention components was modest (from 22.9% for completion of the self-administered home safety assessment to 28.2% for implementation of the geriatric psychiatrist's recommended medication changes). Falls within 1 year after surgical procedures were reported by 228 of 698 patients (32.7%) in the intervention group and 225 of 698 patients (32.2%) in the control group. No significant difference was found in falls between the 2 groups (standardized risk difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, −4.5% to 5.3%). After adjusting for preoperative quality of life, patients in the intervention group had higher physical composite summary scores (3.8 points; 95% CI, 2.4-5.1 points) and higher mental composite summary scores (5.7 points; 95% CI, 4.7-6.7 points) at 1 year compared with patients in the control group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, a multicomponent safety intervention was not associated with reductions in falls within the first year after an elective surgical procedure; however, an increase in quality of life at 1 year was observed. These results suggest a need for other interventions, such as those designed to increase adherence, to lower the incidence of falls after surgical procedures. This cohort study assesses whether a multicomponent intervention incorporating education, home medication review, and home safety assessment is associated with reductions in the incidence of postoperative falls among patients receiving elective inpatient surgical procedures.

Tools for The Relationship Between Duration of General Anesthesia and Postoperative Fall Risk During Hospital Stay in Orthopedic Patients.

The Relationship Between Duration of General Anesthesia and Postoperative Fall Risk During Hospital Stay in Orthopedic Patients.
By:Hata, Takeo;Shima, Hiroaki;Nitta, Masahiko;+5 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Sep2022, volume 18, issue 6, pages e922-e927CINAHL
Objectives: We performed a retrospective observational study to investigate the relationship between general anesthesia duration and postoperative falls of hospitalized patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. Methods: We used electronic medical record data and incident report data from the Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital. The study included 4,042 patients admitted to the Department of Orthopedic Surgery from 2014 to 2018, and the following exclusion criteria were applied: no surgery, less than 18 years of age, and fall between admission and surgery. This study only considered falls that occurred within 21 days of surgery. The multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for patient background was used to determine the risk of falling according to the duration of general anesthesia. Results: After exclusions, 3,398 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 45 patients (1.32%) had fallen, of whom 7 (15.6%) were injured and 2 (4.4%) experienced fractures. Multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the adjusted odds ratio showed that longer general anesthesia duration was an independent risk factor for postoperative falls. In addition, cardiovascular disease had significantly higher associations with postoperative falls. Conclusions: In the postoperative care of orthopedic patients, the risk of falling should be assessed by considering the duration of general anesthesia in addition to the traditional fall risk factors. Furthermore, falls could be prevented by educating patients and their caregivers about the risk and mobilizing staff to support postoperative patients at a higher risk of falls when they walk in the hospital.

Nutrition delivery during hospitalisation after critical illness in Australia and New Zealand: a multicentre, prospective observational study.
By:Ridley, Emma J.;Ainscough, Kate;Bailey, Michael;+17 moreIn:Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics, Feb2025, volume 38, issue 1, pages 1-14 (14p)CINAHL
Background and Aims: Energy and protein provision for critically ill patients who receive oral nutrition often falls below recommended targets. We compared characteristics and nutrition processes during hospital stay (within and post‐intensive care unit [ICU] stay) of those who received oral nutrition as the sole nutrition source to those who first commenced enteral (EN) or parenteral nutrition (PN) within an Australian or New Zealand (ANZ) ICU. Methods: Multicentre, observational study of routine nutrition care in 44 hospitals across ANZ, including adult patients within ICU admitted for at least 48 h. Those receiving oral nutrition as the sole source of nutrition (with or without oral nutrition supplements) were included in the 'oral nutrition' group and those who first received EN and/or PN in the ICU as the 'EN/PN group'. The primary outcome was median daily energy delivery in ICU. Data are presented as number (%) or median [interquartile range]. Results: Of the 409 patients enroled, median [IQR] age was 64 [51–74] years and 257 patients (62%) were male. APACHE II score, use of invasive ventilation and hospital length of stay (LOS) were all lower in those receiving oral nutrition (n = 200) compared to those receiving EN/PN (n = 209). In ICU, 63 (31.5%) and 169 (81%) (p < 0.001), patients who were receiving oral nutrition and in the EN/PN group received a nutrition assessment, respectively. Oral nutrition supplements were provided for 40 (20%) patients in the oral nutrition group and 31 of 94 (33%) of those receiving oral nutrition in the EN/PN group (p = 0.019). Energy and protein intake in ICU for the oral nutrition group was 716 [597–1069] kcal/day and 37 [19–46] g/day versus 1158 [664–1583] kcal/day and 57 [31–77] g/day for those receiving EN/PN (p = 0.020 energy, p = 0.016 protein). Quantification of oral nutrition was attempted in 78/294 (27%) patients in ICU and completed on 27/78 (36%) occasions. On the ward, attempts were made for 120/273 (44%) patients, with 60/120 (50%) complete. Conclusion: Patients who received oral nutrition as the sole nutrition source in ICU had lower illness severity, rates of nutrition assessment and provision of oral supplements compared to those who first received EN/PN. Quantification of oral nutrition was often incomplete for all patients in ICU and on the ward. Key points: This large, multicentre study provides important data about routine nutrition care across hospitalisation in Australian or New Zealand and will inform future research questions and areas for practice change.Patients who received oral nutrition as the sole nutrition source in intensive care unit (ICU) had lower illness severity, rates of nutrition assessment and provision of oral supplements compared to those who first received enteral or parenteral nutrition.Oral nutrition was common within the ICU and on the post‐ICU ward; however, quantification was not commonly performed and was often incomplete when attempted for all patients in ICU and on the ward.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of physical activity during hospital stay on falls, emergency room visits, and rehospitalizations among older patients with dementia at 1 and 6 months post discharge. This is a secondary data analysis. Bidirectional analysis using panel data from a cluster randomized clinical trial was utilized. The sample comprised 455 older adults with dementia from a clustered randomized clinical trial among 12 hospitals in 2 east coast states. The bidirectional relationships between physical activity at 1 and 6 months and falls, emergency room visits, and rehospitalizations at 1 and 6 months post discharge and their relations with physical activity at discharge were assessed using cross-lagged panel models, accounting for the autoregression of physical activity and adverse events over time. Age, race, gender, cognitive status, admission location, comorbidity, and intervention groups were controlled in the modeling. Physical activity at hospitalization discharge showed autoregressive associations for the 3 time points. Patients with a higher level of physical activity at discharge had a lower chance of falling (β = −0.250, SE = 0.094, OR = 0.779, P =.008) and rehospitalizations (β = −0.228, SE = 0.092, OR = 0.796, P =.013) within 1 month post discharge. Falls, emergency room visits, or rehospitalizations at 1 month were not significantly associated with physical activity, or any adverse events at 6 months. The findings from this study highlighted the significance and value of engaging older adults, particularly those living with dementia, in physical activity when hospitalized, as this reduced the likelihood of adverse events such as falls and rehospitalization at least in the first month post discharge.

REVISIÓN DE LA VALIDEZ DE LAS ESCALAS DE VALORACIÓN DEL RIESGO DE CAÍDAS EN PACIENTES HOSPITALIZADOS. [EVIDENCIA COMENTADA].
By:Cervera, Ana Mateo;Fernández Carrasco, SusanaIn:ENE Revista de Enfermeria, Dec2023, volume 17, issue 3, pages 147-154 (8p)CINAHL
Introduction. Patiente falls account for up to 70% of accidents in hospitalized patients. Due to the risk of significant injuries and the increased costs to the healthcare system, reducing falls in hospitals is one of the top priorities for hospital quality and patient safety. The causes of falls have a multifactorial etiology, which complicates the classification of fall risk. Nowadays, it is common practice to incorporate fall risk prediction scales in hospitals, usually carried out by nursing professionals as part of patient safety strategies. However, their validity and accuracy in this environment have not been clearly established, and there is uncertainty about which tool performs best in this regard. Objective: The aim of this revisión is to analyze the validity of different assessment scales of the risk of falls in adults in the hospital environmentcriterio, and especially in older patients. Methods, data sources. The research question includes the following criterion: * population: hospitalized patients * predictive factor/model: fall risk rating scales * outcome variable: fall * time and environment: during hospital stay, in acute units The scales considered for this revisión were the Downton, Morse, Stratify, Hendrich and Tinetti scales, all of them designed to evaluate the risk of falls in the hospital environment. After a search of systematic revisions, it was completed with individual studies. Studies focused on medium- or long-stay hospitalization units were excluded. The subgroup of elderly patients was analyzed separately, selecting data from those studies carried out only in elderly patients or those who provided separate data for this subgroup. From each study, were extracted, the scale used and the cut-off point to consider the high-risk patient, the country, the study design, the type of patient or service where it was performed, the range and average age of the patients, sex, average stay, the source from which the falls were recorded, the number of patients with falls and the study population, true and false positives, and true and false negatives. Sensitivity and specificity are considered in this revision as measures of the predictive validity of the scales. The unit tested in all cases was the number of patients (never the number of falls). Results. Thirty six primary studies were identified that analyzed the validity of the different assessment scales in acutely hospitalized adult patients: Stratify, Morse, Hendrich II, Downton and Tinetti. They included a total of 474,437 participants. Most of the studies were prospective (n = 27), and nine of them were retrospective. The age range of the participants was between 40 and 83 years. The average stay varied between 3 and 32 days, and the percentage of patients who suffered falls during admission varied between 0.18% and 25%. The studies were generally performed in different medical and surgical services. When analyzing the validity of different scales applied to adults in acute care hospital units, it was found that, in comparison to the Downton scale, the Morse scale generally exhibits better sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, the Stratify scale showed better sensitivity and specificity than the Downton scale, but it was slightly inferior to the Morse scale in both parameters. The Hendrich II scale demonstrated sensitivity similar to the Morse scale, with slightly higher specificity than the Downton scale but somewhat lower than both the Morse and Stratify scales. Only one study analyzed the Tinetti scale, showing high sensitivity but very low specificity. After the sensitivity analysis, the Morse scale would still maintain overall superior validity compared to the others. Recommendations. * The correct use of risk evaluation tools requires time, experience and clinical judgment, and training of the personnel who perform them is necessary. * The high variability in the found results suggests the need to assess the performance of these tools in each specific context where they are intended to be used. The widespread adoption of a single scale as the reference standard cannot be recommended * The Clinical Best Practice Guideline for Preventing Falls and Reducing Injuries from Falls (International Affairs & Best Practice) recommends evaluating all hospitalized adults to identify those who are at risk. In those with a positive screening, a comprehensive assessment is recommended, and validated tools can be used. * In older people, most guidelines recommend periodically evaluating the risk of falls and proposing interventions adapted to the risk of falling. * NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines do not recommend using risk prediction tools to evaluate the risk of falls in older hospitalized patients. Instead, they suggest considering all hospitalized patients aged 65 or older to be at high risk for falls, as well as patients aged 50 or older with underlying illnesses.

Tools for Ostomy Care During Hospital Stay for Ostomy Surgery and the United Ostomy Associations of America Patient Bill of Rights: A Cross-sectional Study.

Ostomy Care During Hospital Stay for Ostomy Surgery and the United Ostomy Associations of America Patient Bill of Rights: A Cross-sectional Study.
By:Miller, Leslie RiggleIn:Journal of Wound, Ostomy & Continence Nursing, Nov/Dec2020, volume 47, issue 6, pages 589-593 (5p)CINAHL
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether ostomy patients are receiving ostomy care pre- and postoperatively in accordance with the United Ostomy Associations of America Ostomy and Continent Diversion Patient Bill of Rights. DESIGN: Descriptive, quantitative study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 325 participants with an ostomy living in the United States. All participants underwent ostomy surgery in the United States. METHODS: Participants were recruited through a purposive, nonprobability sampling method based on the presence of an ostomy and the ability to read and understand English. Data were collected between summer 2017 and fall 2018 from ostomy support groups (online and in-person support groups). Respondents completed a self-administered online questionnaire, which included closed-ended and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Forty percent (n = 127) of participants reported not being supervised changing their pouch before discharge. Forty-two percent (n = 137) reported receiving only hands-on instruction on how to care for their ostomy after surgery (no reading materials, nor video tutorial). Slightly more than half (52%; n = 170) reported not receiving support group information, and only 14% (n = 46) indicated participating in a discussion on intimacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that ostomy care at the hospital can improve. Receiving an ostomy is a life-changing operation, and the first line of support for ostomy patients is their provider. Future research should examine ostomy care from providers' perspectives and, prospectively, in order to test care measures on patient health outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an educational intervention would reduce the incidence of functional urinary incontinence (UI) in older adults with a fall-related hip fracture. The project was conducted as a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 109 patients that had been admitted to six hospitals in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) for acute treatment of hip fracture, previously continent and without cognitive impairment, were enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). Intervention (on EG): urinary habit training (Nursing Interventions Classifications taxonomy) was performed during hospital stay (second to fourth postoperative day), with a telephonic reinforcement 10 days after discharge. The CG received routine care. Primary outcome measure: incidence of UI. Follow-up: telephone assessment 3 and 6 months after discharge (blinded evaluation). The incidence of UI at 6 months was 49% (CG) versus 25.5% (EG) (relative risk = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [0.3, 0.9]; number necessary to treat = 4). The mean of UI episodes was 0.54 (EG) versus 1.8 (CG), p =.007. The educational intervention prevents the development of UI and decreases the number of episodes in case of appearance, in a statistically significant way.

Objectives: This study examined the effectiveness of an integrated care pathway (ICP), including a medication algorithm, to treat agitation associated with dementia.Design: Analyses of data (both prospective and retrospective) collected during routine clinical care.Setting: Geriatric Psychiatry Inpatient Unit.Participants: Patients with agitation associated with dementia (n = 28) who were treated as part of the implementation of the ICP and those who received treatment-as-usual (TAU) (n = 28) on the same inpatient unit before the implementation of the ICP. Two control groups of patients without dementia treated on the same unit contemporaneously to the TAU (n = 17) and ICP groups (n = 36) were included to account for any secular trends.Intervention: ICP.Measurements: Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPIQ), and assessment of motor symptoms were completed during the ICP implementation. Chart review was used to obtain length of inpatient stay and rates of psychotropic polypharmacy.Results: Patients in the ICP group experienced a reduction in their scores on the CMAI and NPIQ and no changes in motor symptoms. Compared to the TAU group, the ICP group had a higher chance of an earlier discharge from hospital, a lower rate of psychotropic polypharmacy, and a lower chance of having a fall during hospital stay. In contrast, these outcomes did not differ between the two control groups.Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that an ICP can be used effectively to treat agitation associated with dementia in inpatients. A larger randomized study is needed to confirm these results.

Tools for Mangelernährung bei geriatrischen Patient*innen: Risikofaktor stationäre Langzeitpflege?

Mangelernährung bei geriatrischen Patient*innen: Risikofaktor stationäre Langzeitpflege?
By:Graeb, Fabian;Wolke, ReinholdIn:HeilberufeSCIENCE, Nov2021, volume 12, issue 3/4, pages 58-66 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Malnutrition remains a challenging problem in hospitals, especially among geriatric patients. The background and causes are actually well known but still underestimated in clinical practice. Aim and methods: This study evaluated possible differences in rates of malnutrition risk and malnutrition in geriatric patients living at home and geriatric patients living in residential nursing homes. For this purpose, data from a total of 4 surveys (3 times nutritionDay plus 1 additional survey) were combined and evaluated. In this secondary analysis, 258 patients 65 years and older are included. Malnutrition risk is determined by the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) and malnutrition by the ESPEN criteria. Results: Of the patients 86.0% (n = 222) live at home and 14.0% (n = 36) in residential nursing homes. The patients living in nursing homes have a higher morbidity and need of care. Indicators for the increased morbidity are a larger number of nights spent in the clinic in the last 12 months (mdn 10.0 vs. 5; p 0.007), higher number of daily drug intake (mdn 9.0 vs. 7.0; p 0.002) and greater limitations in walking abilities (mdn 3.0 vs. 1.0; p < 0.001). They are significant older (median 86.0 vs. 78.0; p < 0.001) and show a higher percentage of manifest malnutrition (35.7%; n = 10 vs. 20.1%; n = 40; p 0.062). Conclusion: Geriatric patients living at home and in residential nursing homes show high rates of malnutrition. A malnutrition screening at the beginning and during hospital stay is urgently required in every case as this is the only way to identify those affected. In addition, regular screening in outpatient departments as well as in nursing homes is also necessary.

Tools for 46 Increased Concomitant Burn and Trauma Injuries Follows an Increase in Overall Trauma Volume: A Descriptive Analysis.

46 Increased Concomitant Burn and Trauma Injuries Follows an Increase in Overall Trauma Volume: A Descriptive Analysis.
By:Komak, Spogmai;Jiang, Chuantao;Crocker, Rebecca;+9 moreIn:Journal of Burn Care & Research, 2021 Supplement, volume 42, pages S34-S35CINAHL
Introduction Concomitant traumatic injury in the burn patient complicates care coordination and increases morbidity and mortality. The incidence of concomitant injury, however, is uncommon and reported to range from 5–7%. In May 2020, our level 1 trauma center began seeing 40% more patients per month that the 12 months prior. We sought to determine the incidence of concomitant injury in burn patients during this time of increased trauma volume and to examine the associated traumatic injuries in this group. Methods The burn registry at a single ABA-verified burn center was examined from 5/20–9/20. Patients with concomitant burn and traumatic injury were examined with respect to: %TBSA burn, mechanism of injury, operative interventions, associated traumatic injuries, and length of hospital stay. Continuous data was presented as mean (standard deviation). Results Eighty-nine burn patients were admitted during this period, of whom 24 (26.9%) had concomitant traumatic injuries. The cohort was young and mostly male; the mean TBSA was 16% () (Table 1). The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (12 or 50%), followed by fall after high voltage electrical injury (6 or 25%) and motorcycle collisions (5 or 21%). The most common associated injuries were: pulmonary contusions 29.1% (7/24); long bone fractures 25% (6/24); pelvic/acetabular fractures 20.8% (5/24); femur fractures 16.6% (4/24); and solid organ injury: 16.6% (4/24). Twenty patients (83.3%) required burn or trauma operative intervention during hospital stay. Of the 20 patients who required operative intervention, 85% underwent burn surgery and 55% underwent trauma surgery (solid organ or orthopedic). Forty percent of these patients required operation for both burn and traumatic injury. In looking specifically at the electric injury group, all six patients required operative intervention for burn injuries, and four required extremity fasciotomy. Patients with electrical injury had a significantly longer hospital stay relative to their TBSA (p< 0.04). Conclusions Concomitant trauma and burn injuries are infrequent yet present a major clinical challenge. Our recent increase in overall trauma volume was paralleled by an increase in patients with concomitant burn injuries. The associated traumatic injuries require a multi-disciplinary approach to minimize morbidity and restore function.

Tools for Temporal Patterns of Patient Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility: A Retrospective Analysis.

Temporal Patterns of Patient Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility: A Retrospective Analysis.
By:Khalil, Ahmed;DeAngelo, Brock;Paulson, Andrew;+1 moreIn:American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Jul2025, volume 104, issue 7, pages 675-678 (4p)CINAHL
Patient falls are a frequent safety issue in inpatient rehabilitation settings, especially during early admission days when patients face physical limitations and unfamiliar environments. This study reveals high-risk periods for falls that align with peak patient activities and staff shift changes. The findings suggest that targeted fall prevention strategies during these times could significantly enhance patient safety and optimize staff resources in rehabilitation facilities. Falls are a significant safety concern in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, where patients often face increased risk due to functional impairments. This retrospective study examined fall trends across days after admission and daily 2-hr intervals within a single rehabilitation hospital. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant decline in fall rates over time, suggesting a decrease in fall risk as patients acclimate and improve physically. However, two peak periods for falls were identified during early morning and evening hours, aligning with heightened patient activity and staff shift changes. These findings emphasize the need for targeted fall prevention strategies during the initial days after admission and specific high-risk times of the day. Implementing tailored interventions for these critical periods may reduce fall incidents and enhance patient safety in rehabilitation settings.

Tools for Laboratory frailty index improves prediction of in-hospital falls among older adults.

Laboratory frailty index improves prediction of in-hospital falls among older adults.
By:Nakashima, Hirotaka;Imaizumi, Takahiro;Komiya, Hitoshi;+6 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, 05/06/2025, volume 37, issue 1, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Aims: To explore the association between Frailty Index based on laboratory tests (FI-lab) and in-hospital fall risk in older adults, and to explore whether incorporating FI-lab improves the predictive accuracy of a traditional fall risk prediction tool. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from patients aged ≥ 60 years who were admitted to Nagoya University Hospital in 2020. We assessed fall risk using the St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients (STRATIFY). We calculated FI-lab based on 35 common laboratory parameters tested on admission. Each fall was reported prospectively by nurses through computer-based incident report forms. The relationship between FI-lab and in-hospital falls was analyzed using multivariate binomial logistic regression. Predictive performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Missing data were not imputed and internal validation used 1000-bootstrap optimism-correction. Results: Data for 5984 patients were included (mean age 73 years, 63.5% male). The mean FI-lab score was 0.31 ± 0.16. Falls occurred in 175 patients (2.9%) during a median hospital stay of 9 days. FI-lab was associated with falls independently of STRATIFY. Adding FI-lab to STRATIFY significantly improved its predictive accuracy, increasing AUROC from 0.674 to 0.715 (p = 0.018), with NRI of 0.413 (p < 0.001). Calibration slope after internal validation was 0.97. Conclusions: FI-lab on admission was independently associated with in-hospital fall risk and improved the predictive ability of STRATIFY. FI-lab could be a valuable component in more accurate fall prediction.

Inpatient falls have a significant impact on the outcomes of older patients during inpatient rehabilitation. A retrospective case-control study was conducted using data of 7066 adults aged 55 yrs or older to evaluate significant predictors of inpatient falls during inpatient rehabilitation and the association of inpatient falls with discharge destination and length of stay. A stepwise logistic regression was used to model odds of inpatient falls and home discharge with demographic and clinical characteristic variables and a multivariate linear regression to evaluate the association between inpatient falls and length of stay. Nine hundred thirty-one of 7066 patients (13.18%) had inpatient falls during inpatient rehabilitation. The group with inpatient falls had longer length of stay (14.22 ± 7.82 vs. 11.85 ± 5.33 days, P < 0.0001) and a decreased proportion of home discharges when compared with the group without inpatient falls. There were increased odds of inpatient falls among patients with diagnoses of head injury, other injuries, a history of falls, dementia, a divorced marital status, and a use of laxatives or anticonvulsants. Inpatient falls were associated with an increased length of stay (coefficient = 1.62, confidence interval = 1.19–2.06) and decreased odds of home discharge (odds ratio = 0.79, confidence interval = 0.65–0.96) after inpatient rehabilitation. This knowledge may be incorporated into strategies for reducing inpatient falls during inpatient rehabilitation.

Tools for Risk of Home Falls Among Older Adults After Acute Care Hospitalization: A Cohort Study.

Risk of Home Falls Among Older Adults After Acute Care Hospitalization: A Cohort Study.
By:Adams, Christy M.;Tancredi, Daniel J.;Bell, Janice F.;+2 moreIn:Journal of Trauma Nursing, Nov/Dec2024, volume 31, issue 6, pages 281-289 (9p)CINAHL
BACKGROUND: Acute care hospitalization has been associated with older adult home falls after discharge, but less is known about the effects of hospital- and patient-related factors on home fall risk. OBJECTIVES: This study compares the effects of hospital length of stay, medical condition, history of falls, and home health care on period rates of home falls after discharge from acute care hospitalization. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing period rates of home injury falls among older adults (age ≥ 65) occurring after discharge from an acute care hospitalization. Data were collected from state health care utilization administrative records between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018. We used log-linear Poisson regression to model post-discharge injury fall incidence rates as a function of days since discharge and patient-level covariates. RESULTS: A total of 736,230 older adults were included in the study cohort. Absolute risk for post-discharge home falls was 7%. Fall rates were highest the first week after discharge at 0.05 per 100 person-days, with a period incidence rate 74.29 times higher than the >90-day discharge period. Fall risk increased with age, with the highest risk in the ≥85 age group. Fall risk increased for a 2-day hospital stay but decreased for 5- to 30-day stays, compared to a 1-day length of stay. Discharge to home health care and history of falls were associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are at highest risk for a home fall the first 7 days after discharge from acute care hospitalization. These findings describe patient-related risk factors that acute care hospitals can use to develop geriatric-specific discharge guidelines intended to reduce home fall risk during the early care transition to home.

• Limited data is available related to the early initiation of canagliflozin in AHF patients. • A prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, randomized equivalence trial aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of early canagliflozin initiation compared to empagliflozin in hospitalized AHF patients with volume overload, regardless of their diabetic status. • Canagliflozin was equivalent to empagliflozin in diuresis effect. Canagliflozin also resulted in comparable decreases in congestion and NT-proBNP levels, lowering HF events and enhancing patients' quality of life. • When compared to empagliflozin, canagliflozin was both safe and well tolerated in AHF patients. Early initiation of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in acute heart failure (AHF) patients increases urine output, reduces hospital stays, and enhances quality of life post-hospital discharge. This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of early canagliflozin initiation compared to empagliflozin in hospitalized AHF patients with volume overload. This was a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, randomized equivalence trial. AHF diabetic and non-diabetic patients were randomized within 24 h from hospital admission to either receive 100 mg canagliflozin or 10 mg empagliflozin in addition to the standardized protocol for an intravenous loop diuretic. The primary outcome was the median of daily diuresis during the hospitalization period. Hospitalized AHF patients were enrolled (71 patients per group). The median daily diuresis during the hospitalization period was 4200 ml in the canagliflozin group, which was statistically equivalent to empagliflozin (4117 ml) with a difference of 83 ml, which falls within the predefined equivalence margin (±10) % of the median of daily diuresis of empagliflozin; Δ = ±411.7 mL), confirming equivalence via bootstrap TSOT p < 0.001. No difference was observed in diuretic response, dyspnea score, orthodema congestion score or length of hospital stay. The NT-proBNP level at day 30 post-discharge and the change in KCCQ-TSS from baseline to day 90 were statistically comparable between both groups, without differences in safety event incidence. Canagliflozin could be a part of usual care for hospitalized AHF patients and an alternative to empagliflozin without safety concerns. [Display omitted]

Tools for Fall rates by specialties and risk factors for falls in acute hospital: A retrospective study.

Fall rates by specialties and risk factors for falls in acute hospital: A retrospective study.
By:Heikkilä, Anniina;Lehtonen, Lasse;Junttila, KristiinaIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Aug2023, volume 32, issue 15/16, pages 4868-4877 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Falls are common adverse events in acute care hospitals, and about 25–50% of fallers suffer injuries. In acute care, fall rates range from 0.4–9 falls per 1000 patient days, varying among unit types, patient characteristics, and diseases. Several risk factors have been identified, including recent falls, age, reduced mobility, cognitive ability and polypharmacy. Several countries have become an aging society in which an increasing number of older patients need acute care. Therefore, the prevention of falls has become one of the most important aspects of patient safety. Aim and Design: This retrospective study aimed to explore adults' inpatient falls in a Finnish university hospital with several specialties. The objectives were to draw an overall picture of fall rates in Finnish acute care, and to model risk factors for falls including secondary diagnoses. Methods: The study was conducted in a large university hospital in Finland. The data consisted of patients' electronic health records from 2014–2016 and included a total of 114,951 adult patients. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression model analysis was used to identify risk factors for falls and multiple imputation was used to missing data. The study reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. Results: A total of 841 falls were recorded, totalling 1.5 falls per 1000 patient days, and the rate of falls with injury was 0.4 per 1000 patient days. The regression model included the following risk factors: increasing old age, prolonged hospital stays, specialty of neurology, mode of arrival (emergency care and hospital transfer), no operation during hospital stays and secondary diagnoses such as dementia, pneumonia and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: In acute care, falls occur most in patients with neurological diagnoses and least in surgical patients. Risk factors for falls include increasing age, emergency arrival, hospital transfer and prolonged hospital stay. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Educational interventions to improve healthcare professionals' competence and preventive interventions to avoid inpatient falls need to be prioritized in medical specialties with high fall rates.

Phenotyping to predict 12-month health outcomes of older general medicine patients.
By:Woodman, Richard John;Bryant, Kimberly;Sorich, Michael J.;+4 moreIn:Aging Clinical & Experimental Research, 02/22/2025, volume 37, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: A variety of unsupervised learning algorithms have been used to phenotype older patients, enabling directed care and personalised treatment plans. However, the ability of the clusters to accurately discriminate for the risk of older patients, may vary depending on the methods employed. Aims: To compare seven clustering algorithms in their ability to develop patient phenotypes that accurately predict health outcomes. Methods: Data was collected for N = 737 older medical inpatients during their hospital stay for five different types of medical data (ICD-10 codes, ATC drug codes, laboratory, clinic and frailty data). We trialled five unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means, K-modes, hierarchical clustering, latent class analysis (LCA), and DBSCAN) and two graph-based approaches to create separate clusters for each method and datatype. These were used as input for a random forest classifier to predict eleven health outcomes: mortality at one, three, six and 12 months, in-hospital falls and delirium, length-of-stay, outpatient visits, and readmissions at one, three and six months. Results: The overall median area-under-the-curve (AUC) across the eleven outcomes for the seven methods were (from highest to lowest) 0.758 (hierarchical), 0.739 (K-means), 0.722 (KG-Louvain), 0.704 (KNN-Louvain), 0.698 (LCA), 0.694 (DBSCAN) and 0.656 (K-modes). Overall, frailty data was most important data type for predicting mortality, ICD-10 disease codes for predicting readmissions, and laboratory data the most important for predicting falls. Conclusions: Clusters created using hierarchical, K-means and Louvain community detection algorithms identified well-separated patient phenotypes that were consistently associated with age-related adverse health outcomes. Frailty data was the most valuable data type for predicting most health outcomes.

Tools for Role of sarcopenia risk in predicting COVID-19 severity and length of hospital stay in older adults: a prospective cohort study.

Role of sarcopenia risk in predicting COVID-19 severity and length of hospital stay in older adults: a prospective cohort study.
By:Ahmadiani, Elham Sadat;Ariyanfar, Shadi;Soroush, Mohammadreza;+1 moreIn:British Journal of Nutrition, 06/14/2023, volume 129, issue 11, pages 1888-1896 (9p)CINAHL
Sarcopenia is more common in the elderly and causes adverse outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study assessed the association of sarcopenia risk with the severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission and during hospitalisation and the length of hospital stay. Two hundred patients (aged ≥ 60 years) who were hospitalised for COVID-19 were enrolled using consecutive sampling between 29 December 2020 and 20 May 2021. The sarcopenia score of the patients was assessed using the Strength, Assistance in walking, Rising from a chair, Climbing stairs, and Falls questionnaire. The severity of COVID-19 was determined using the modified National Early Warning Score (m-NEWS) system for 2019 n-CoV-infected patients at admission (T1), day three (T2) and at discharge (T3). Data were analysed using SPSS, version 22 and STATA, version 14. Of the 165 patients included, thirty four (20·6 %) were at risk of sarcopenia. The length of hospital stay was slightly longer in patients with sarcopenia risk, but the difference was not significant (P = 0·600). The adjusted OR of respiratory rate (RR) > 20 /min at T1 for the sarcopenia risk group was 6·7-times higher than that for the non-sarcopenic group (P = 0·002). According to generalised estimating equations, after adjusting for confounding factors, the m-NEWS score was 5·6 units higher in patients at risk of sarcopenia (P < 0·001). Sarcopenia risk could exacerbate COVID-19 severity and increase RR at admission, as well as the need for oxygen therapy at discharge.

Tools for Implementing primary care follow-up for high-risk vascular surgery patients.

Implementing primary care follow-up for high-risk vascular surgery patients.
By:Ford, Elizabeth;Fitzpatrick, Suzanna;Rosenberger, SarahIn:Journal of Vascular Nursing, Sep2024, volume 42, issue 3, pages 159-164 (6p)CINAHL
• Unplanned 30-day hospital readmissions create a burden on the patient and an organization. • Close hospital discharge follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) is associated with a lower risk of hospital readmission for non-surgical issues. • A transitional care clinic at the organization acts as a successful bridge for patients without a PCP. Background : The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consider the 30-day hospital readmission rate an outcome of care measure; a high rate is associated with high-cost and bed utilization. Purpose : The Division of Vascular Surgery at a large academic medical center implemented a 15-week quality improvement project in the fall of 2022 to reduce readmissions among patients deemed high-risk for readmission and discharged to home. Methods : The discharging provider utilized the "HOSPITAL Score for Readmission" tool to identify patients at high-risk for unplanned 30-day readmission to receive the intervention, which included follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) within two weeks of hospital discharge to address non-surgical medical conditions that may have been exacerbated during the hospital stay. A hospital based transitional care clinic bridged medical care for identified patients without an established PCP or whose PCP could not accommodate an appointment until PCP assumption of care. Discharging providers included 11 nurse practitioners and 2 surgery residents; each received a one-on-one educational teaching session and a weekly reminder e-mail through week 9. Results : A total of 158 vascular surgery patients (low and high-risk) were discharged home over 15 weeks with 30 patients (19%) having an unplanned readmission within 30-days from discharge. Adherence issues with the intervention among staff allowed for the high-risk group to be divided into those who did not receive the intervention versus those who did. The high-risk patients who did not receive the intervention had a higher readmission rate (30.4%) than the high-risk patients who did receive the intervention (21.4%). Conclusions : Numerous acute and chronic medical problems were treated at the PCP/transitional care clinic visits, which may have contributed to the reduction in rate of readmissions occurring within 30-days for those patients. Increased usage of the transitional care clinic identified a gap that patients continue to require assistance with establishing care with a PCP and further process change in the future is needed to ensure successful transition for all patients.

THE ADDITION OF A DEDICATED MOBILITY TEAM TO IMPROVE PATIENT AMBULATION AND OUT-OF-BED RATES.
By:HAN, JOHN;JUNE, KALEB;CAMPOS, THERESE;+2 moreIn:International Journal of Safe Patient Handling & Mobility (SPHM), Sep2024, volume 14, issue 3, pages 100-104 (5p)CINAHL
Mobility within the hospital is a well-documented means of rehabilitation and a necessary step in the holistic treatment of patients. Early ambulation is associated with improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs to the hospital. Traditionally, the responsibility of patient mobilization often falls upon nurses but is often missed -- one alternative option explored is having a mobility team with the sole responsibility of mobilizing patients. During a hospital campaign on patient mobility, 4 undergraduate students were recruited as this mobility team and trialed in their university-affiliated hospital. The mobility team was deployed twice weekly for 4 hours each time attempting to mobilize patients with Johns Hopkins level ≥ 6 (an evidence-based assessment tool of patient mobility; level ≥ 6 means the patient is ambulatory). The results revealed the addition of the mobility team at trial units, compared to comparison units, led to both improved patient ambulation rate and out-of-bed metric (P<0.05). The results endorse the use of a dedicated mobility team to improve patient mobility during hospital bed stays

Introduction: With the growing population of the elderly in societies, the medical problems of this age range also increases. Preventable accidents are among these problems. More than 5 million people die as the result of these injuries each year. Therefore, the present study was done aiming to evaluate the causes and outcomes of preventable accidents in the elderly. Methods: The present study is a retrospective cross-sectional one, performed on elderly patients admitted to a hospital during 2 years. Required data were gathered using census method via a checklist consisting of demographic data, cause of the accident, length of hospital stay, number of times revisiting the hospital, and final outcome. Data were then descriptively analyzed using SPSS 16 statistical software. Results: 2336 patients with the mean age of 72.24 ± 9.02 years were evaluated (50.7% female). The most common causes of accidents were falling with 1033 (44.2%) cases, intentional poisoning with 382 (16.4%) cases, and unintentional poisoning with 360 (15.4%) cases, respectively. Mean length of hospital stay was 5 ± 7.7 days. 144 (6.2%) elderly patients died during the study period. Type of accident (p < 0.001) and final outcome (p < 0.001) were significantly different between the sexes. Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, falling, intentional poisoning and unintentional poisoning, respectively, were the most common causes of preventable accidents in the studied elderly population. Most cases were discharged after partial recovery and the 3 afore-mentioned causes had higher prevalence in women. The most frequent outcomes were complete recovery in poisoning, partial recovery in falling, and death in poisoning and burn.

Tools for Preoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium among Holocaust survivors who achieved longevity.

Preoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium among Holocaust survivors who achieved longevity.
By:Weiss, Yotam;Zarour, Shiri;Kiselevich, Yossef;+6 moreIn:Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Jun2024, volume 72, issue 6, pages 1831-1838 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Holocaust survivors (HS) experience higher rates of physiological and psychological morbidities, increasing their vulnerability to perioperative complications. Limited information exists regarding their perioperative neurocognitive disorders. This study aimed to assess the rates of preoperative cognitive impairment, postoperative delirium, and other complications among HS aged 75+ undergoing elective surgery. Methods: This is a single‐center retrospective cohort study that analyzed prospectively collected data. All surgical patients born before 1945 who underwent elective noncardiac surgery at a tertiary hospital in Israel during 2020–2021 were included. The HS group was identified through the hospital's information system. Preoperative cognitive impairment was assessed using the Mini‐Cog test. Postoperative delirium was defined as a combined outcome, which included a positive 4A's‐Test (4AT) result during the postanesthesia care unit stay up to the second postoperative day, a positive 3‐Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D‐CAM) test administered by the geriatric team, and identification through the medical records using the Chart‐based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART‐DEL). We used multivariable regression to assess the risk factors for postoperative delirium. Results: Out of 1332 eligible patients, 422 (32%) were HS, while the others served as controls. Both groups had a similar rate of preoperative cognitive impairment (24%, p = 0.89) and postoperative delirium (16%, p = 0.95). HS exhibited a higher risk of the composite adverse events (24% vs. 20%, p = 0.05, aOR [95% CI] 1.3 [1.0–1.7]), driven mainly by falls during hospitalization (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.03, aOR 2.1 [1.1–4.1]). HS patients were more likely to be childless (33% vs. 11%, p = 0.001) and had higher rates of chronic antidepressant and benzodiazepine use. Conclusions: HS achieving longevity do not face increased risks of preoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium. However, special care is still warranted due to their elevated rate of other complications during hospitalization.

Tools for The effectiveness of Function Focused Care among patients acutely admitted to hospital: A stepped wedge cluster trial.

The effectiveness of Function Focused Care among patients acutely admitted to hospital: A stepped wedge cluster trial.
By:Kok, Selma;Schoonhoven, Lisette;Vernooij, Lisette M.;+5 moreIn:International Journal of Nursing Studies, Dec2024, volume 160, page N.PAGCINAHL
During acute hospital admission, patients often experience loss of functional status. A low level of physical activity is associated with higher levels of loss of functional status. Stimulating physical activity to maintain functional status is considered essential nursing care. Function Focused Care is a promising approach stimulating physical activity. In a previous study, Function Focused Care in Hospital was deemed feasible. To determine the effectiveness of Function Focused Care in Hospital compared with usual care on the functional status of hospitalized stroke and geriatric patients. A multicenter stepped wedge cluster trial. A neurological and a geriatric ward of an academic hospital and a general hospital in the Netherlands participated in this study; each was considered a cluster in the trial. The primary outcome was patients' functional status over time, measured with the Barthel Index and Elderly Mobility Scale. Secondary outcomes were the patients' length of stay, fear of falling, self-efficacy, motivation, resilience, and outcome expectations for functional and exercise activities. Data was collected at hospital admission (baseline), day of discharge, and three and six months after discharge via patient files and questionnaires and analyzed with generalized linear mixed models. In total, we included 892 patients, of which 427 received Function Focused Care in Hospital and 465 received usual care. Although we did not find significant differences in the Barthel Index and Elderly Mobility Scale at discharge or follow-up, we found a significant decrease in the mean length of stay (− 3.3 days, 95 % CI − 5.3 to − 1.1) in favor of the Function Focused Care in Hospital group. In addition, in the Function Focused Care in Hospital group, a larger proportion of patients were discharged to home compared to the control group (38.2 % vs. 29.0 %, p = 0.017), who were discharged more often to a care facility. The length of hospital stay was substantially decreased, and discharge to home was more common in the group receiving Function Focused Care in Hospital with equal levels of independence in Activities of Daily Living and mobility in both groups upon discharge. Although significant differences in the Barthel Index and Elderly Mobility Scale were not found, we observed that neurological and geriatric patients were discharged significantly earlier compared to the control group. https://onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/24287 (date of first recruitment: 05-02-2016). Tweetable abstract : Patients receiving Function Focused Care in Hospital were discharged from the hospital 3.3 days earlier and discharged home more often than the group of patients receiving care as usual. @umcutrecht @hogeschoolutrecht.

A retrospective study of the incidence and characteristics of long-stay adult inpatients with hospital-acquired malnutrition across five Australian public hospitals.
By:Woodward, Talia;Josephson, Christine;Ross, Lynda;+5 moreIn:European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2020, volume 74, issue 12, pages 1668-1676 (9p)CINAHL
Background/objectives: While malnutrition is prevalent in hospitals, little is known about patients who first become malnourished during the hospital stay. This study aimed to determine the incidence and describe the characteristics of patients who developed hospital-acquired malnutrition (HAM) across five Australian public hospitals.Subjects/methods: A retrospective clinical audit of hospital data was conducted. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with a length of stay (LOS) > 14 days in a Metro South Health hospital between July 2015 and January 2019 were eligible. Demographic and clinical data were sourced from hospital data and medical records. Dietitians reviewed the medical records of patients clinically coded with malnutrition to determine HAM incidence. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to determine patient descriptors associated with HAM, compared with those not malnourished or those malnourished on admission.Results: A total of 17,717 patients were eligible (45% F, 63 ± 20 years, LOS 24 (15-606) days). HAM incidence in long-stay patients was 1%, with an overall malnutrition prevalence of 18%. Patients with HAM had an ~26 days longer LOS than patients who were malnourished on admission or not malnourished (p < 0.001). Longer LOS; patient inter-hospital transfer from or to another hospital; or experiencing cognitive impairment, pressure injury or a fall while in hospital were associated with HAM (OR 1.006-3.6, p < 0.05).Conclusions: Incidence of HAM, defined as malnutrition first diagnosed >14 days after admission, was in the low end of the published range. HAM was significantly associated with long LOS, transferring between hospitals and developing a cognitive impairment, pressure injury or fall during admission.

Introduction: Due to the aging of the population, nursing processes have been adapted to these patients, who require a high level of care and guidance. Objective: Analyzing the degree of dependence on nursing care by elderly patients (65 years or older) with femur fractures. Materials and Methods: retrospective, with a quantitative approach, carried out in a private hospital from April 2021 to April 2022. According to the Patient Classification System (PCS), the sample comprehends 41 patients, analyzed epidemiological data and degree of dependence Study of nursing care during hospitalization, environment of hospitalization, and discharge. Results: Composed of 41 patients, mean age of 84 years and female predominance (75.61%). Concerning fractures, there was a greater occurrence due to falls from standing height and a predominance of neck fractures, with an average time until surgery of less than 16 hours. Systemic Arterial Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were predominant. The average of the PCS estimates presented 24.26 in the 1st, 26.12 in the 2nd, and 26.24 in the 3rd. The length of hospital stay was 7 days and no deaths were reported. Discussion: The findings on sociodemographic data, reasons for falls, location, comorbidities, degree of dependence, and length of hospital stay are similar to those available in databases. They differ, in better quality, under time until surgery and clinical. Conclusions: The study presents specific knowledge to carry out the care of the intrahospital nursing process, thus allowing the systematization of the team's assistance.

Providing Personalized Interest-Based Activities to Prevent Delirium: A Multicomponent Quality Improvement Initiative in an Acute Care Setting.
By:Qianwen Liu;Brown, Elena V. Donoso;Johnson, Shauni;+1 moreIn:Open Journal of Occupational Therapy (OJOT), Fall2023, volume 11, issue 4, pages 1-15 (15p)CINAHL
Background: Hospital-induced delirium is a prevalent condition across inpatient settings, frequently impacting older adults' recovery. A 10-week multi-component quality improvement (QI) project was designed for an existing delirium prevention program in four acute care units, aiming to support patient and caregiver engagement in delirium prevention activities. Method: The participants were hospitalized adults who were 70 years of age and older and met specific inclusion criteria. The project provided personalized interest-based activities, orientation stimulation, and caregiver education. An abbreviated version of the Modified Interest Checklist was used to identify the participants' activity choices. Activity daily logs, satisfaction survey, and delirium and fall incidence were collected to measure project participation and outcomes. Results: Thirty-two older adults participated in the QI project (mean age = 79.63 years). The most frequently selected interest-based activities were cognitive stimulation activities, such as word searches, and reading activities related to instrumental activities of daily living. Among 25 satisfaction surveys completed, 24 (96%) participants reported feeling "very supported" by the project. Only two QI participants developed delirium, and none of them had a fall during the hospital stay. Conclusion: This QI project showed high participant use and satisfaction with promising low rates of delirium incidence and falls indicating further investigation.

Tools for Retrospective analysis of 15 years of horse-related maxillofacial fracture data at a major German trauma center.

Retrospective analysis of 15 years of horse-related maxillofacial fracture data at a major German trauma center.
By:Stier, Rebecca;Tavassol, Frank;Dupke, Claudia;+4 moreIn:European Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, Aug2022, volume 48, issue 4, pages 2539-2546 (8p)CINAHL
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of the mechanism of trauma (fall versus kick), rider demographics, equestrian experience, protective equipment, and whether or not a horse was shod on the anatomic site of a horse-related maxillofacial fracture, operating time, postoperative complication rate, and length of hospital stay. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients treated for horse-related maxillofacial fractures at a single institution in Germany between January 2000 and March 2015. We used linear and logistic regression to test the above-mentioned variables for statistical correlations. Results: During the study period, we treated 138 horse-related facial fractures in 71 patients. The mean patient age was 34.5 years, and 80.3% of the injuries occurred in women. Most of the maxillofacial fractures were the result of a horse kick (71.8%) when unmounted and the majority occurred in more experienced riders (70.4%). There was a significant association of wearing of protective equipment with a shorter hospital stay and lower risk of postoperative complications. Conclusion: More education is needed in the equestrian community regarding the use of protective equipment when unmounted. Safety helmets should be redesigned to include a faceguard and be worn at all times.

Relation between hyponatraemia and falls by acute hospitalised patients: A case‐control study.
By:Aranda‐Gallardo, Marta;Gonzalez‐Lozano, Antonio;Oña‐Gil, Jose Ivan;+3 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Apr2022, volume 31, issue 7/8, pages 958-966 (9p)CINAHL
Aims and objectives: To investigate the possible association between hyponatremia and falls, in a sample of hospitalised adult patients. Background: In‐hospital falls are a problem of major importance, provoking a significant decline in the quality of life of many patients. Recent studies have identified a relationship between such falls and the presence of hyponatremia. Design: Analytical retrospective observational case‐control study. Methods: The study population consisted of hospitalised patients who had suffered an in‐hospital fall during the period 2014–2016. For each case, two controls who had not suffered any such fall were recruited. These cases and controls were matched according to gender, age, hospitalisation unit and date of admission. Study data were obtained from the hospital's record of falls, regarding the patients' socio‐demographic factors, physical and psychological conditions and blood levels of sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine. The study is reported in accordance with STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Results: The study sample consisted of 555 patients (185 cases and 370 controls). Hyponatraemia was detected in 57 cases (30.8%). A statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of hyponatraemia and the occurrence of falls: OR = 2.04. Other risk factors for falls were hypercreatinaemia OR 2.49, hyperuraemia OR 1.82, disorientation, need for ambulatory assistance and longer hospital stay. Conclusions: From the study findings, we conclude that hyponatraemia is a predictor of falls by acute hospitalised patients. Further research is needed on the relationship between hypercreatinaemia, hyperuraemia and falls. Relevance to clinical practice: The assessment of risk factors for falls, such as hyponatraemia, can alert us to the possibility of this event occurring and facilitate the implementation of preventive measures. This parameter should be included as a significant new factor in assessment instruments designed to assess the risk of falls, thus enhancing the reliability and diagnostic validity of these instruments.

Tools for The Effectiveness of the Joint Commission International Accreditation in Improving Quality at King Fahd University Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A Mixed Methods Approach.

The Effectiveness of the Joint Commission International Accreditation in Improving Quality at King Fahd University Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A Mixed Methods Approach.
By:Shawan, Deema AlIn:Journal of Healthcare Leadership, Feb2021, volume 13, pages 47-61 (15p)CINAHL
Introduction: Saudi Arabia has one of the highest numbers of health organizations accredited by the Joint Commission International. This study aimed to measure this process's effectiveness in improving quality at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the study investigated health providers' perceptions of this process. Materials and Methods: This research utilized a convergent parallel mixed method. For the quantitative analysis, an interrupted time series was conducted to assess the changes in a total of 12 quality outcomes pre- and post-accreditation. Thematic analysis was utilized to collect and analyze qualitative data from hospital employees and health providers. Results: The quantitative results indicated that pursuing accreditation positively impacted nine out of 12 outcomes. The improved outcomes included: the average length of stay, the percentage of hand hygiene compliance, the rate of nosocomial infections, the percentage of radiology reporting outliers, the rate of pressure ulcers, the percentage of the correct identification of patients, the percentage of critical lab reporting, and the bed occupancy rate. The outcomes that did not improve were the rate of patients leaving the ER without being seen, the percentage of OR cancelations, and the rate of patient falls. The qualitative analysis suggested that the accreditation process was perceived positively by participants. Nevertheless, participants also highlighted some of the drawbacks of this process, including: the potential bias in observation-based key performance indicators, the focus on improving process without enhancing the hospital structure, and the increased workload. Conclusion: International accreditation had a positive impact on quality and was received positively by providers. However, several issues need to be addressed by hospital administrators in future accreditation cycles. According to participants, the most notable issue during the first two accreditation cycles was the increased workload and paperwork, which can potentially distract from patient care.

Background: In the last two decades, there have been major improvements in the trauma system in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We aimed to study the changes in the incidence, type, severity, and outcome of trauma of hospitalized child-bearing age women in Al-Ain City, UAE, during that time. Methods: Data from two separate trauma registries of Al-Ain Hospital, which were prospectively collected from March 2003 to March 2006 and January 2014 to December 2017, were analyzed retrospectively. All women aged 15–49 years were studied. The two periods were compared. Results: Trauma incidence of hospitalized child-bearing age women was reduced by 47% during the second period. There were no significant differences in the mechanism of injury between the two periods. Road traffic collision was the main cause of injury (44% and 42%, respectively) followed by fall down (26.1% and 30.8%, respectively). The location of injury was significantly different (p = 0.018), with a strong trend of more home injuries in the second period (52.8% compared with 44%, p = 0.06). There was a strong statistical trend of mild traumatic brain injury (GCS 13–15) in the second period (p = 0.067, Fisher's Exact test). Those who had normal GCS of 15 were significantly higher in the second period compared with those in the first period (95.3% compared with 86.4%, p < 0.001, Fisher's Exact test) despite having more anatomical injury severity of the head (AIS 2 (1–5) compared with 1 (1–5), p = 0.025). The NISS was significantly higher in the second period (median (range) NISS 5 (1–45) compared with 4 (1–75), p = 0.02). Despite that, mortality was the same (1.6% compared with 1.7%, p = 0.99) while the length of hospital stay was significantly less (mean (SD) 5.6 (6.3) days compared with 10.6 (13.6) days, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The incidence of trauma in hospitalized child-bearing-age women was reduced by 47% over the last 15 years. Road traffic collisions and falls are the leading cause of injury in our setting. Home injuries increased over time. The mortality remained stable despite the increased severity of injured patients. More injury prevention efforts should target home injuries.

Background: Screening of sarcopenia is proposed to identify patients who require the diagnosis of this condition. One of the proposed screening tools is Strength, Assistance with walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, Fall and Calf Circumference (SARC‐CalF). However, evidence for its applicability, especially in a hospital setting, is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between "suggestive signs of sarcopenia using SARC‐CalF" and clinical outcomes. Methods: Prospective cohort study with hospitalized patients aged ≥60 years was conducted, and they were evaluated within 48 h of admission using the SARC‐CalF tool. Calf circumference and handgrip strength were measured, and the "timed get up and go" test was performed in all patients. The outcomes for testing the predictive validity of SARC‐CalF were prolonged length of hospital stay, in‐hospital death, hospital readmission, and mortality in 6 months. Results: Of the 554 patients (55.22 ± 14.91 years old, 52.9% males) evaluated, 17.3% were classified as having "suggestive signs of sarcopenia using SARC‐CalF." In univariate analysis, "suggestive signs of sarcopenia using SARC‐CalF" was associated with in‐hospital death (P =.002) and mortality in 6 months (P =.004). However, in the multivariate analysis, these associations were not significant. Conclusion: SARC‐CalF was not an independent predictor of clinical outcomes during the hospitalization neither in the following 6 months of discharge.

• The first lockdown did not affect the incidence of hip fractures in older adults. • Personal and management characteristics were not affected by the lockdown. • During the lockdown, living alone increased incidence of hip fractures. • More patients were operated by senior surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the effects of the lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the incidence and characteristics of hip fracture in older adults. Data from the three-month lockdown period and the corresponding period in the previous year were obtained from the computerized medical records of a large acute-care hospital. No significant differences were observed in the absolute and relative numbers of hip fractures. There were no significant differences in terms of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, which are considered risk factors for falls. Similarly, there was no difference in the length of time between admission and surgery and the mean length of hospital stay. Compared to the previous year, there was a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in older adults living alone during the lockdown. Health policy should provide social support and monitoring of healthcare, particularly to older adults living alone.

Introduction: Injury caused by large animals varies according to the regional distribution of the animals and their relationship to humans. Camels are usually friendly to humans; however, occasionally they become very hostile, especially in rutting season. Most in-hospital trauma deaths are related to head injury. Very few studies in the literature have discussed camel-related head injuries. We aimed to study the incidence, mechanism of injury, types, and outcome of camel-related head injury in a high-income developing country to give recommendations on preventive measures. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from all patients who were admitted to Al Ain Hospital with a camel-related head injury from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2021. Data collected included demography, mechanism of injury, anatomical location, severity of the injury, associated injuries, and management. The patients were followed up during their hospital stay to record the length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. Results: During the study period, 98 patients were admitted to Al Ain Hospital with camel-related injury. Thirty-nine (39.8%) of the admitted patients with a camel-related injury sustained a head injury; a camel-related head injury was more common during August (23.1%). Thirty-four (87.2%) patients were camel caregivers. Thirty-three patients (84.6%) were injured on farms. Seven patients suffered an intracranial hemorrhage, and six (85.7%) of them had a history of fall from a camel. Glasgow Coma Score was significantly correlated to the severity of head injury measured by Abbreviated Injury Severity of the head (P = 0.006, Spearman's correlation). One patient died during the study period after having decompressive craniectomy for subdural hemorrhage (overall mortality 2.6%). Conclusions: The majority of camel-related head injury occurred in camel caregivers at camel farms and can be considered a work-related injury. Careful handling of camels, especially during the summertime can reduce the toll of camel-related head injury and its serious consequences. None of the injured patients was wearing a helmet at the time of injury. Legislation for compulsory helmet usage by camel caregivers at farms may decrease the incidence of head injuries in those patients.

Tools for ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FRAILTY AND INTRA-HOSPITAL MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS HOSPITALIZED IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL.

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FRAILTY AND INTRA-HOSPITAL MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS HOSPITALIZED IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL.
By:de Oliveira, Jeremias Bruno Silva;Sousa, Luciana de Lima;de Moura, Tayla Gomes;+3 moreIn:Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy, Apr2024:Supplement 1, volume 28, page N.PAGCINAHL
Frailty is a decline in the functioning of several body systems, accompanied by an increase in vulnerability to stressors. The condition is related to high risk of falls, hospitalizations, all-cause mortality, and disability, which poses challenges to public health. There is no consensus regarding frailty. Indeed, several validated instruments based on different conceptual approaches have been developed. Professionals face a challenge when attempting to make a clinical assessment that discriminates between low and high-risk groups. There is a scarcity of frailty assessment data for hospitalized older adults. Understanding aspects related to frailty in a hospital setting is essential to providing comprehensive care to these individuals. Investigate the association between frailty criteria at hospital admission and intra-hospital death in older patients. This is a longitudinal observational study of 170 older adults hospitalized in a public hospital of the Federal District, Brazil. Frailty and mortality were the independent and dependent variables, respectively. The former was assessed using the frailty phenotype, considering unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow gait and low physical activity level, and participants were categorized as non-frail, pre-frail or frail. Intra-hospital mortality was collected in the healthcare electronic medical chart system (TrackCare). The older patients were categorized into two groups: those that were discharged and those that died. Data analysis was descriptive and using the chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U and simple and multiple logistic regression tests. Demographic (age and sex) and clinical data (number of medications and body mass index- BMI) were collected to adjust the analyses. 7.1% of the older adults hospitalized during the study period were non-frail, 34.1% pre-frail and 58.8% frail, and 7.1% died during their hospital stay. The group that died exhibited more frailty criteria (U=510.500; p=0.006) and more frequent muscle weakness (X²(1)=7.412; p=0.006) and slow gait (X²(1)=5.636; p=0.030). These individuals showed no differences in age, sex, education level, BMI and medications when compared to their discharged counterparts (p>0.05). In simple regression analyses, one more frailty criterion increased the likelihood of intra-hospital death by 110% (OR=2.100 [95% CI 1.201 – 3.673]). Adjusted multiple analyses did not change the simple regression results. Older adults with more frailty criteria exhibited a greater likelihood of intra-hospital death. The findings reveal the risk of intra-hospital death in hospitalized frail older patients and therefore, the need for multiprofessional monitoring of these individuals from the moment they are admitted. Understanding frailty in a hospital setting may contribute to the development of healthcare, screening, health indicator and prevention strategies aimed at improving care and prognosis for these individuals.

Background: Frailty affects up to 51%of the geriatric population in developing countries which leads to increased morbidity and mortality.Objective: To determine the association between pre-operative frailty through multidimentional assessment score, and the incidence of post-operative complications and to validate Robinson score in geriatric Egyptian patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.Methods: We recruited 180 elderly participants aged 60 years old and above, who underwent elective cardiac surgery. They were divided into frail, pre-frail, and non-frail groups after application of Robinson score (which includes cognitive and functional and fall risk assessment, number of comorbidities, and different laboratory data). Type and duration of operations and the presence and severity of complications at days 3 and 7 post-surgery, and the 30-day readmission rate were assessed.Results: Operation duration and the occurrence of postoperative complications at days 3 and 7 were lowest in non-frail and highest in the frail group (p < 0.001 for both). Length of hospital stay and 30-day readmission rate also increased in the frail group. A positive, moderate correlation between frailty and blood transfusion (r = 0.405) and functional dependence (r = 0.552) was found at day-3 post-surgery. Finally, logistic regression analysis identified a 6-fold increase in postoperative complications in the frail group (OR = 6).Conclusion: Preoperative frailty was associated with higher incidence of postoperative complications among geriatric patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Frailty assessment by Robinson score can be considered as an accurate tool to predict postoperative complications during preoperative assessment of elderly patients.

Tools for Orthogeriatrie in der primären und Revisions-Hüftgelenkendoprothetik.

Orthogeriatrie in der primären und Revisions-Hüftgelenkendoprothetik.
By:Habicht, Ivana M.;Randau, Thomas M.;Wirtz, Dieter C.In:OUP - Orthopädische und Unfallchirurgische Praxis, 2022, volume 11, issue 6, pages 269-275 (7p)CINAHL
In regard to the planning of elective surgery such as a primary total hip arthroplasty, the time available before the operation should be used to prepare the patient as optimally as possible. Preoperative optimization is also useful and necessary when determining the indication for revision surgery, but is often not possible to the same extent due to the urgent surgical indication (e.g. significant loosening, periprosthetic infection). However, an examination and treatment of possible riskfactors complications and accompanying morbidities should still be carried out as far as possible. A multi-professional team is useful during the hospital stay so that the perioperative risks such as delirium, falls and thrombosis can be reduced. The choice of surgical technique is also crucial. Hybrid treatment (cementless cup and cemented stem) is used in regard to early mobilization and a lower failure rate in older patients. Finally, the choice of follow-up care is also crucial for the outcome. A complex geriatric treatment with, if necessary, subsequent geriatric rehabilitation offers the possibility of individual treatment and rapid recovery of everyday life. In summary, the treatment of frail patients in orthopedic surgery is complex and should be carried out by an interdisciplinary and experienced treatment team.

INTRODUCTION: Hospitalisation represents a significant risk factor for the decline in the general conditions of the elderly. Loss of autonomy in elderly inpatients, together with immobilisation, has been defined as 'Hospital-Acquired Disability' and affects 65% of this class of patients. Less than half of them will regain independent mobilisation. Included among the negative effects are: falls, increased percentage of admission to nursing homes, longer hospital admissions, increased mortality and morbitity. Despite these facts, elderly patients remain in bed for 83-95% of their hospital stay; they rarely walk or are mobilised. Only on an international level has this issue been analysed OBJECTIVES: To analyse active mobilisation in inpatients. METHODS: Prospective analytical and descriptive study performed from December 2018 - May 2019 in the Clinical Medicine department of the AUSL of Reggio Emilia. Descriptive analysis of the data has been performed. RESULTS: A total of 1725 patients were screened for the study. After applying the inclusion criteria, 295 patients were enrolled in the study, 9 of which were then excluded for failure to be mobilised. 66.4% of these patients were mobilized the morning during hygiene-rounds. According to the nurse, they appeared in a stable state, alert and oriented (88.1%) and used a variety of aids (from 1 to 3) (57.3%). The frequency of mobilisations were: 44.4% once a day, 31.2% twice, 24.4% three times or more. DISCUSSION: This study highlighted that mobilisation is strictly correlated to first assi-stance, frequently relying on health care assistants, and is mostly applied to oriented patients who only need one assistant. Further studies are required to investigate connections between patient's features and mobilisation.

Tools for Bismuth Tribromophenate Gauze is Superior to Silver Sulfadiazine Cream for Mixed-depth Scald Burns in Children.

Bismuth Tribromophenate Gauze is Superior to Silver Sulfadiazine Cream for Mixed-depth Scald Burns in Children.
By:Alessio-Bilowus, Dominic;Kumar, Nishant;Nolan, Ryan;+3 moreIn:Journal of Burn Care & Research, 2023 Supplement 2, volume 44, page S172CINAHL
Introduction: Silver sulfadiazine 1% cream was historically the mainstay initial treatment for burn wounds at our pediatric burn center. Over the last several years, we transitioned to using closed dressings of 3% bismuth tribromophenate petrolatum gauze in the initial care of partial thickness burns with the goal of reducing the pain experienced with daily wound cleaning necessitated when using silver sulfadiazine. The gauze adheres to the wound, allows exudate to drain through, and acts as a scaffold for re-epithelialization after which it falls off without traumatizing the healed burn. The purpose of this study is to compare our burn patient outcomes with the initial use of bismuth tribromophenate gauze to those in patients treated with silver sulfadiazine cream. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of our patients aged 5 years and younger presenting with mixed-depth scald injuries within two time frames: 1) years 2004- 2008, during which silver sulfadiazine 1% cream was the standard initial choice for wound care at our institution, and 2) years 2015-2018, when 3% bismuth tribromophenate petrolatum gauze had become standard. Data collected included demographics, burn total body surface area (TBSA), length of hospital stay, need for excision or grafting, time to grafting, and graft size. Results: Three hundred forty-seven patients were included, 200 of whom were treated with silver sulfadiazine cream and 147 treated with only bismuth tribromophenate gauze. Burn TBSA and rates of skin grafting were similar between the two groups; however, the mean area of the skin graft was significantly smaller (p = 0.027) among the patients in the bismuth tribromophenate group (147 cm2) compared to those in the silver sulfadiazine group (336 cm2). On the other hand, the time from injury to skin grafting was significantly longer in the bismuth tribromophenate group (24 days vs. 9.9 days, p = 0.002), with a larger proportion of these patients returning for elective grafting in the outpatient setting. Conclusions: The percentage of patients who required skin grafting in both groups was similar; however, initial treatment with a closed dressing of 3% bismuth tribromophenate petrolatum gauze promotes healing in the zone of stasis, resulting in smaller skin grafts and hence smaller donor sites. The mechanical forces of daily wound cleaning when using silver sulfadiazine cream likely harm those areas at risk, leading to the need for larger skin grafts for coverage. Although time to grafting was longer when using gauze, these patients were in closed dressings with fewer painful changes. Applicability of Research to Practice: Bismuth tribromophenate petrolatum gauze remains on a wound bed for up to three weeks, whereas silver sulfadiazine cream must be changed regularly resulting in constant disruption of the healing tissue. Fewer dressing changes combined with later skin grafting could allow burn wounds to demarcate and heal more effectively, benefiting both graft and donor sites.

Tools for Costs Attributable to Falls Based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) Analysis of Hospitalised Patients: A Case–Control Study.

Costs Attributable to Falls Based on Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) Analysis of Hospitalised Patients: A Case–Control Study.
By:Fernández-Castro, Mercedes;Rivas-González, Noel;Martín-Gil, Belén;+4 moreIn:Nursing Reports, Sep2025, volume 15, issue 9, page 323CINAHL
Background/objectives: Falls are the most common adverse events in hospitals. This study aimed to estimate excess hospitalisation costs attributable to inpatient falls, using Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) relative weights as a proxy for resource consumption. Methods: Case–control study. Cases included patients who had sustained a fall during hospitalisation between 2020 and 2022 in 19 inpatient units. Controls were selected with matching technique based on age and admission period. Diagnosis-Related Groups and their resource consumption and cost estimators (relative weights) were provided by the Hospital's Coding Unit. Results: A total of 613 falls were analysed against 623 controls. The Diagnosis-Related Group 'Lower limb amputation except toes' was associated with a fourfold higher risk of falling compared to others. Five more were identified in which the case group incurred significantly higher costs than the control group. These included three surgical Diagnosis-Related Group, 'Urethral and transurethral procedures', 'Heart valve procedures without acute myocardial infarction or complex diagnosis', and 'Arterial procedures on the lower limb', and two medical, 'Heart failure' and 'Major pulmonary infections and inflammations'. Conclusions/Implications for practice: Identifying Diagnosis-Related Groups in which falls are associated with increased hospitalisation costs allows for a comprehensive assessment of the process, taking into account resource consumption and the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients. These findings will enable nurses to develop targeted strategies to enhance the safety of hospitalised patients that contribute to the sustainability of the healthcare system.

Tools for Visitor Restrictions During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Increased Falls With Harm at a Canadian Hospital: An Exploratory Study.

Visitor Restrictions During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Increased Falls With Harm at a Canadian Hospital: An Exploratory Study.
By:Shennan, Stephanie;Coyle, Natalie;Lockwood, Brittany;+1 moreIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Sep2024, volume 20, issue 6, pages 434-439 (6p)CINAHL
Background: Falls with harms (FWH) in hospitalized patients increase costs and lengths of stay. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more FWH. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased patients in isolation with fewer visitors. Their relationship with falls has not been previously studied. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-site, 12-month before pandemic12-month after pandemic, observational study. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to model FWH outcome and associations with isolation and visitor restrictions. Results: There were 4369 isolation events and 385 FWH among 22,505 admissions during the study period. Unadjusted analysis demonstrated a FWH risk of 1.33% (95% CI 0.99, 1.67) in those who were placed in isolation compared to 1.80% (95% CI 1.60, 2.00) in those without an isolation event (χ² = 4.73,P = 0.03). The FWH risk during the different visitor restriction periods was significantly higher compared to the prepandemic period (χ² = 20.81, P < 0.001), ranging from 1.28% (95% CI 1.06, 2.50) in the prepandemic period to 2.03% (95% 1.66, 2.40) with no visitors permitted (phase A) in the pandemic period. After adjusting for potential confounders and selection bias, only phase A visitor restrictions were associated with an increased FWH risk of 0.75% (95% CI 0.32, 1.18) compared to no visitor restrictions. Interpretation: Our results suggest a moderately strong association between hospitalized patient FWH risk and severe visitor restrictions. This association was muted in phases with even minor allowances for visitation. This represents the first report of the adverse effects of visitor restriction policies on patients’ FWH risks.

Tools for Prism Adaptation Treatment May Reduce In-Hospital Falls Among Individuals With Spatial Neglect After Stroke.

Prism Adaptation Treatment May Reduce In-Hospital Falls Among Individuals With Spatial Neglect After Stroke.
By:Chen, Peii;Noce, Natalia;DeBel, Emily;+2 moreIn:Neurorehabilitation & Neural Repair, Jun2025, volume 39, issue 6, pages 464-472 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Spatial neglect (SN) is a risk factor of in-hospital falls among stroke survivors. Our prior study showed that receiving more sessions of prism adaptation treatment (PAT) in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) predicted greater SN reduction and functional improvement. Objective: To identify circumstances of falls specific to SN and explore whether increasing PAT sessions may reduce fall incidence. Methods: The present study was a retrospective analysis of fall-related documentation, clinical data and notes regarding SN assessment, and treatment as part of standard care. Records of 3020 patients admitted to an IRF after stroke were reviewed, and 1489 (49%) had SN based on the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Results: A total of 276 patients (9% of all patients) fell at least once during their IRF stay, and 173 fallers (67% of all fallers) had SN. SN increased fall incidence (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.44, P =.005) after controlling for 5 covariates including age, sex, cognitive and motor functional level at admission, and length of stay. While independent of type or cause of falls, SN was associated with location of falls—SN increased fall incidence in hospital rooms (IRR = 1.55, P =.024), after controlling for the 5 covariates. 62 (36%) of fallers with SN received a median of 4.5 PAT sessions (range = 1-11; interquartile range = 2-10). Increased PAT sessions were associated with fewer falls after PAT (IRR = 0.82, P =.022), controlling for the 5 covariates and 2 additional factors including CBS and number of falls before PAT. Conclusions: Treatment for SN such as PAT should be considered to reduce the risk of falls in these patients. Future research is needed to determine fall prevention measures for stroke survivors with SN, especially in their hospital rooms.

Tools for Reducing Effects of HospitalAssociated Deconditioning in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

Reducing Effects of HospitalAssociated Deconditioning in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
By:Schmitz, Jena;Weigl, Brittany;Patterson, Amy;+3 moreIn:Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing, Oct2025, volume 29, issue 5, pages 416-422 (7p)CINAHL
Prolonged hospitalization and treatment-related toxicities increase the risks of immobility and decreased functional status in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). This quality improvement project evaluated whether targeted education and access to a stationary elliptical bike (SEB) could reduce hospital-associated deconditioning in 106 adult patients undergoing allo HSCT. Using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, findings suggest that SEBs are a safe and feasible approach for preserving functional status during prolonged hospitalization in patients undergoing allo HSCT.

Tools for Optimizing Nurses' Time: Reducing Assessment Frequency in General Care.

Optimizing Nurses' Time: Reducing Assessment Frequency in General Care.
By:Chambers, Stephanie P.;Slack, Stephanie M.;Carlson, Marny L.;+2 moreIn:AJN American Journal of Nursing, Aug2025, volume 125, issue 8, pages 50-54 (5p)CINAHL
Background: Nurses represent a limited resource in the hospital environment. For decades, inpatient nurses have conducted head-to-toe assessments in roughly the same manner. At Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the practice has been twice-daily head-to-toe assessments, without reviewing the benefit of this frequency (vis-à-vis once daily) for patients, staff, and the institution. Purpose: This quality improvement (QI) project in a general care setting explored whether decreasing comprehensive physical assessments from twice daily to once daily was associated with changes in patient safety or care quality. Staff satisfaction was also assessed. Methods: After a pilot project showed the feasibility of changing to once-daily assessments, a QI project was conducted to compare a once-daily frequency of head-to-toe assessments with a twice-daily frequency for all adult patients admitted to a general medical unit. The intervention period was between August 1 and October 31, 2023; one assessment was performed between 7 AM and 7 PM in all patients not receiving hospice care or requiring more frequent assessments because of specific disease processes. Comparison data were obtained from patients who were on the unit in the three months before the intervention, from May 1 through July 31, 2023. Outcomes were patient safety events, code blue events, and rapid response team calls; hospital length of stay; performance rates of other required assessments (as a counterbalance measure), including delirium, pressure injury, and fall risk; and compliance with the new assessment schedule. Results: At the conclusion of the intervention period, no significant increases in reported patient safety events, code blue events, rapid response team calls, or hospital length of stay were observed. There were no decreases in compliance with required assessments, except for pressure injury, which decreased enough during the first month of the intervention to result in a statistically significant difference between the pre- and postintervention periods; however, compliance returned to baseline by the conclusion of the project. Among nursing staff, compliance with the once-daily assessment practice was high (80%), and staff feedback was positive; 96% of respondents indicated they would like to see the practice continue. Conclusion: The results of this QI project suggest that head-to-toe assessment frequency in the adult general medical patient population could be reduced to once daily without adversely affecting patient outcomes or safety. Further research is warranted to examine whether these results can be extrapolated to other units and institutions. This quality improvement project examined whether decreasing comprehensive physical assessments from twice daily to once daily affected patient safety or care quality, and also assessed staff satisfaction with the practice change.

Objectives. To estimate the probability of adverse events based on the length of emergency department (ED) stay prior to hospitalization in patients aged > 65 treated in Spanish EDs. Method. All patients aged $ 65 years treated in 52 Spanish EDs during a 1-week period and included in the EDEN (Emergency Department and Elder Needs) Registry who were hospitalized and had available data on the length of ED stay were included in the study. Adverse events considered were in-hospital mortality and prolonged hospitalization (> 7 days) in patients discharged alive. Non-linear models using restricted cubic splines were applied to estimate the probability of adverse events as a function of the length of ED stay, and crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, adjusting for 13 demographic, baseline health, and vital sign variables. First-order interactions with covariates were also examined. Results. A total of 6,333 patients were included. The length of ED stay ranged from 0 to 240 hours prior to hospital admission (median, 6 hours; and 12.6%, 3.5%, 1.5%, and 0.2% of patients remained in the ED for more than 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, respectively). A total of 683 patients (10.8%) died during hospitalization, and among survivors, 2,734 (46.9%) experienced prolonged hospitalization. Compared with patients with a 12-hour ED stay (reference), those with stays of 6 and 3 hours had adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality of 1.11 (1.01-1.22) and 1.22 (1.03-1.44), and defor prolonged hospitalization of 0.89 (0.84-0.95) and 0.83 (0.75-0.93), respectively. For ED stays of 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, the adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality were 1.00 (0.94-1.06), 1.18 (0.97-1.43), 1.39 (0.98-1.97), and 2.70 (1.02-7.13), and for prolonged hospitalization, 1.14 (1.09-1.19), 1.39 (1.17-1.62), 1.66 (1.25-2.21), and 3.53 (1.60-7.76), respectively. Patients with functional limitation and hypotension showed a stronger association between the length of ED stay and in-hospital mortality, while those aged < 80 years and without prior falls showed a stronger association between the length of ED stay and prolonged hospitalization. Conclusions. Both short and long ED stays in patients who are subsequently hospitalized were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, shorter stays were associated with a lower likelihood of prolonged hospitalization, whereas longer stays were associated with a higher likelihood of prolonged hospitalization. These associations may be significantly stronger in certain patient subgroups.

Tools for Impact of the End PJ Paralysis interventions on patient health outcomes at the participating hospitals in Alberta, Canada.

Impact of the End PJ Paralysis interventions on patient health outcomes at the participating hospitals in Alberta, Canada.

Purpose: Multiple hospitals in Alberta implemented the End PJ Paralysis – a multicomponent inpatient ambulation initiative aimed at preventing the adverse physical and psychological effects patients experience due to low mobility during admission. To inform a scale-up strategy, this study assessed the impact of the initiative based on select process and outcome measures. Materials and methods: Clinical and administrative data were obtained from the hospital Discharge Abstract Database, Research Electronic Data Capture (Redcaps), and Reporting and Learning System for Patient Safety. The variables explored were length of stay, inpatient falls, discharge disposition, pressure injury, patient ambulation, and patient dressed rates. We then used the Interrupted Time Series design for impact analysis. Results: The analysis included discharge abstracts for 32,884 patients and the results showed significant improvements in outcomes at the participating units. The length of stay and inpatient falls were reduced immediately by 1.8 days (B2=-1.80, p = 0.044, 95% CI [-3.54, −0.05]), and 2.2 events (B2=-2.22, p = 005, 95% CI [-3.75, −0.69]). The percentage of patients discharged home increased overtime (B2=.39, p=.006, 95% CI [.11,.66]). Mobilization and dressed rates also improved. Conclusions: The findings imply the interventions safely mitigated the risk of immobility-induced complications, including deconditioning and hospital-acquired disability. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Immobility during hospitalization is endemic in hospitals and, without intervention, presents a significant risk of physiological deconditioning and subsequent adverse health outcomes, such as functional decline and hospital-acquired disability. This study elevates the importance of preserving functional capacity and dignity of hospitalized patients by encouraging them to get up, dress in personal clothes, and move as much possible. Function-focused initiatives, that include intentional patient ambulation, have the potential to mitigate the risk of immobility-induced deconditioning and other adverse outcomes, such as falls and pressure injury, in older adults. In this study, we have demonstrated the End PJ Paralysis had a positive impact on patient ambulation, length of stay, inpatient falls, and discharge disposition. The study also informed a proposed transformational roadmap to strengthen rehabilitation in the provincial health system and spread the initiative to all the major hospitals to potentially benefit more patients.

Tools for The effects of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery: a retrospective cross-sectional study.

The effects of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery: a retrospective cross-sectional study.
By:Alzahrani, Khalid H;Luhaybi, Mawaddah Al;Sayeed, Abdan Bin;+3 moreIn:International Journal of Therapy & Rehabilitation, Jun2025, volume 32, issue 6, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background/Aims: Total knee replacement is a surgical procedure used to restore function and reduce pain in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis. Effective pain management can prevent complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, enables faster recovery, reduces hospital stays and improves functional outcomes. Research has found that during the 48 hours following surgery, patient-controlled epidural analgesia provided superior analgesia compared to other conventional analgesic methods. However, its impact on early rehabilitation after total knee replacement remains understudied as regards the efficacy and safety. The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to evaluate the impact of patient-controlled epidural analgesia on early rehabilitation programmes following total knee replacement surgery, while also investigating the influence of other factors that may affect early mobilisation after surgery. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to review the data of patients who received patient-controlled epidural analgesia for pain following elective unilateral total knee replacement surgery between January 2017 and August 2022, who were referred to rehabilitation in the Security Forces Hospital in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Two groups of patients were analysed, those who started mobilising on the first day and those who started mobilising on the second day following surgery. Results: A total of 186 patients were included in this study with a mean age at admission of 68.12 ± 7.59 years. Most patients (84.4%) started mobilising on the first day after surgery and (15.6%) started on the second day. When comparing mobilised patients on the first and second days, there was a statistically significant difference (P≤0.05), between the groups in terms of dizziness and hypotension. However, there were no statistically significant relationships between ambulation start and patient-controlled epidural analgesia method, dose, kind of adjunct pain medication or Bromage Score. There was no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups on the first day following surgery (P>0.05). Patients who mobilised on the first day demonstrated significantly higher levels of independence in their daily activities, as measured by the Elderly Mobility Scale and Barthel Index (P≤0.05). Conclusions: Patient-controlled epidural analgesia within a multimodal pain management plan following total knee replacement surgery does not adversely affect early rehabilitation and can contribute to the successful attainment of functional independence. Implications for practice: The use of patient-controlled epidural analgesia provides effective analgesia in the postoperative period after total knee replacement surgery and is associated with few serious complications and facilitated early rehabilitation.

Tools for Consequences of Inpatient Falls in Acute Care: A Retrospective Register Study.

Consequences of Inpatient Falls in Acute Care: A Retrospective Register Study.
By:Heikkilä, Anniina;Lehtonen, Lasse;Junttila, KristiinaIn:Journal of Patient Safety, Aug2024, volume 20, issue 5, pages 340-344 (5p)CINAHL
Aims: The objectives of this study were (1) to explore the consequences of falls; (2) to find out time and place of the fall events; and (3) to explore the impact of falls on the length of hospital stays in adults' inpatient acute care. Background: In hospitals, falls are the most common accidents that can occur to a patient during hospitalization. Injuries resulting from serious falls can cause lifelong harm to the patient due to loss of well-being and independence. Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional, register study based on the data from electronic patient records was conducted. Methods: The data included 114,951 inpatients, of which 743 had fallen. Data was collected between January 2014 and December 2016. Results: One-third of falls caused injury. Most injuries were to the head area, and the most common injuries were pain or confusion. The falls usually occurred at the beginning of the treatment in the patient's room or on the way to the toilet. Falls in the hospital increased the length of stay. Conclusions: A large proportion of falls occur at the beginning of treatment, so it is important to start fall prevention measures as soon as the patient arrives at the hospital.

Tools for Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital episodes for falls and fractures associated with new-onset disability and frailty in England: a national cohort study.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital episodes for falls and fractures associated with new-onset disability and frailty in England: a national cohort study.
By:Thomas, Seth;Littleboy, Kathryn;Foubert, Josephine;+8 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Apr2024, volume 53, issue 4, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background Older people with frailty are at risk of harm from immobility or isolation, yet data about how COVID-19 lockdowns affected them are limited. Falls and fractures are easily measurable adverse outcomes correlated with frailty. We investigated whether English hospital admission rates for falls and fractures varied from the expected trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how these varied by frailty status. Methods NHS England Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care data were analysed for observed versus predicted outcome rates for 24 January 2020 to 31 December 2021. An auto-regressive integrated moving average time-series model was trained using falls and fracture incidence data from 2013 to 2018 and validated using data from 2019. Models included national and age-, sex- and region-stratified forecasts. Outcome measures were hospital admissions for falls, fractures, and falls and fractures combined. Frailty was defined using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. Results 144,148,915 pre-pandemic hospital admissions were compared with 42,267,318 admissions after pandemic onset. For the whole population, falls and fracture rates were below predicted for the first period of national lockdown, followed by a rapid return to rates close to predicted. Thereafter, rates followed expected trends. For people living with frailty, however, falls and fractures increased above expected rates during periods of national lockdown and remained elevated throughout the study period. Effects of frailty were independent of age. Conclusions People living with frailty experienced increased fall and fracture rates above expected during and following periods of national lockdown. These remained persistently elevated throughout the study period.

Tools for Non-Severe Hypophosphatemia in Older Patients: A Systematic Review.

Non-Severe Hypophosphatemia in Older Patients: A Systematic Review.
By:Barbarossa, Luca;Zandonà, Martina;Garo, Maria Luisa;+2 moreIn:Nutrients, Apr2025, volume 17, issue 8, page 1354CINAHL
Background/Objectives: Phosphorus plays a fundamental role in cellular and extracellular metabolism, contributing to nucleic acid synthesis, enzymatic activity, neurologic function, and skeletal mineralization. Despite its significance, non-severe hypophosphatemia (HP) remains largely asymptomatic and underdiagnosed, with limited data on its prevalence in the general population. Most studies focus on specific subgroups, such as critically ill or dialysis patients, while the impact of mild HP in older adults, a potentially vulnerable demographic, is not well understood. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the prevalence and clinical implications of non-severe HP in older adults. Methods: The study followed PRISMA guidelines to assess HP in patients aged ≥ 65 years without critical illnesses or genetic disorders. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (March 2024). Eligible studies included RCTs and prospective/retrospective studies, excluding cancer-related studies or insufficient phosphate data. Results: We identified 1350 articles, with 26 meeting eligibility criteria. Ultimately, eight studies involving 26,548 patients were included, with an HP prevalence of 12.5%. Studies reveal a higher prevalence of HP in frail individuals, particularly those with increased frailty scores, and an association between HP and cognitive decline, depressed mood, falls, and chronic comorbidities. HP was also prevalent in infectious diseases, especially bacterial pneumonia, with longer hospital stays and increased mortality rates. Malnutrition was significantly more common in HP patients, characterized by weight loss and poor nutritional status. Furthermore, HP increased fall risk during hospitalization and worsened outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, including higher mortality and graft failure rates, underscoring its clinical importance. Discussion: This review identified that non-severe hypophosphatemia (HP) is associated with conditions such as frailty, cognitive decline, and an increased risk of falls. The evidence suggests that low phosphate levels may negatively impact health, increasing mortality and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Despite limitations in diagnostic criteria and sample variability, the findings indicate that HP can be a useful marker for identifying patients at risk of health deterioration. Further research is needed to clearly define the management and treatment of HP in this vulnerable population.

Tools for Description and Implications of Falls in Patients Hospitalized Due to COVID-19.

Description and Implications of Falls in Patients Hospitalized Due to COVID-19.
By:Venema, Dawn M.;Hester, Amy;Clapper, Kellie;+4 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Care Quality, Apr-Jun2024, volume 39, issue 2, pages 121-128 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Many hospital quality indicators, including falls, worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may be at risk for falling due to the disease itself, patient characteristics, or aspects of care delivery. Purpose: To describe and explore falls in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We pooled data from 107 hospitalized adult patients who fell between March 2020 and April 2021. Patients who fell had a current, pending, or recent diagnosis of COVID-19. We analyzed patient characteristics, fall circumstances, and patient and organizational contributing factors using frequencies, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test. Results: Patient contributing factors included patients' lack of safety awareness, impaired physical function, and respiratory concerns. Organizational contributing factors related to staff and the isolation environment. Conclusions: Recommendations for managing fall risk in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 include frequent reassessment of risk, consideration of respiratory function as a risk factor, ongoing patient education, assisted mobility, and adequate staff training.

Tools for A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Multi-interventional Approach for Fall Prevention.

A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Multi-interventional Approach for Fall Prevention.
By:Najafpour, Zhila;Arab, Mohammad;Rashidian, Arash;+3 moreIn:Quality Management in Health Care, Apr-Jun2024, volume 33, issue 2, pages 77-85 (9p)CINAHL
Background and Objectives: Falls are one of the most common adverse events at hospitals that may result in injury and even death. They are also associated with raised length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs. This experiment aimed to examine the effectiveness of multiple interventions in reducing inpatient fall rates and the consequent injuries. Methods: The present study was a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. It was done in 18 units in a public university hospital over 36 weeks. Patients included in this research were at risk of falls. Overall, 33 856 patients were admitted, of whom 4766 were considered high-risk patients. During the intervention phases, a series of preventive and control measures were considered, namely staff training; patient education; placement of nursing call bells; adequate lighting; supervision of high-risk patients during transmission and handovers; mobility device allocation; placement of call bell and safe guard in bathrooms; placing "fall alert" signs above patients' beds; nurses informing physicians timely about complications such as delirium and hypoxia; encouraging appropriate use of eyeglasses, hearing aids and footwear; keeping side rails up; and reassessing patients after each fall. The primary outcome was participant falls per 1000 patient-days. Secondary outcomes were fall-related injuries and LOS. Results: The results revealed a decrease in fall rate (n = 4 per 1000 patient-days vs 1.34 per 1000 patient-days, incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.26]; P= .001) and injuries (n = 2.4 per 1000 patient-days vs 0.79 per 1000 patient-days, IRR = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.15-0.32]; P= .001) in exposed compared with unexposed phases. There was not a significant difference in LOS (exposed mean 10.63 days [95% CI, 10.26-10.97], unexposed mean 10.84 days [95% CI, 10.59-11.09], mean difference = -0.13 [95% CI, -0.53 to 0.27], P= .52). Conclusions: This multi-interventional trial showed a reduction in falls and fall rates with injury but without an overall effect on LOS. Further research is needed to understand the sustainability of multiple fall prevention strategies in hospitals and their long-term impacts.

Tools for Behavioural and psychological symptoms of people with dementia in acute hospital settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Behavioural and psychological symptoms of people with dementia in acute hospital settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
By:Anantapong, Kanthee;Jiraphan, Aimorn;Aunjitsakul, Warut;+6 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Jan2025, volume 54, issue 1, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can complicate acute hospital care, but evidence on BPSD in this setting is heterogeneous. Objective To determine the prevalence of BPSD in acute hospitals and explore related risk factors, treatments, and outcomes (PROSPERO: CRD42023406294). Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for studies on BPSD prevalence among older people with dementia during their acute hospital admissions (up to 5 March 2024). Independent double-review processes were used for study screening, selection, and data extraction. Data on 12 BPSD symptoms were extracted based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) and Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE- ad). Risk factors, treatments, and outcomes were summarised. Meta-analysis was used to synthesise results. Results Out of 15 101 records, 30 articles from 23 studies were included. Most studies were rated as moderate (n = 12) to poor (n = 17) quality. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of overall BPSD (one or more BPSD symptoms) at 60% (95% CI = 43–78%) among older inpatients with dementia in acute hospitals (N = 11 studies). Subgroup analysis showed variations in the overall BPSD prevalence based on assessment tools (BEHAVE- ad  = 85%, NPI = 74%, Others = 40%). Common BPSD symptoms included aggression/agitation (39%), sleep problems (38%), eating problems (36%), and irritability (32%). BPSD were linked to delirium, pain, increased use of uncomfortable interventions, psychotropic medication uses and higher caregiver distress. Poor patient-staff interactions and fragmented discharge plans often led to frequent emergency admissions and hospital readmissions. Conclusion Healthcare systems should implement tailored approaches for managing BPSD in acute hospitals, enhance staff training, improve caregiver communication, and develop integrated discharge plans.

Retrospective multi-centre cohort study of polypharmacy, the Drug Burden Index and associations with outcomes in older surgical inpatients.
By:Liu, Bonnie Mengyuan;Fujita, Kenji;Thillainadesan, Janani;+2 moreIn:Age & Ageing, Sep2025, volume 54, issue 9, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
Background Comprehensive medication utilisation and its association with outcomes are not well described in older surgical inpatients. Objectives Investigate medication utilisation and the associations of the number of medications and exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medications measured using the Drug Burden Index (DBI exposure) with outcomes in older surgical inpatients. Methods A multi-centre retrospective cohort study of surgical patients ≥65 years at five Australian hospitals admitted for ≥48 hours, from 4 January 2022 to 3 January 2023. The number of regular medications was counted on admission and discharge. DBI exposure throughout admission was calculated using the area under the curve for DBI/days of admission (AUC DBI/days). Multilevel regression was conducted for outcomes on/during admission [falls, adverse drug events (ADEs), delirium, pressure ulcers, Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), length of stay (LOS)]. Results The 13 815 participants (51.1% male) had a median (IQR) age of 77 (71–84) years. The median number of medications was 5 (2–9) on admission and 9 (6–13) on discharge. The median AUC DBI/days was 0.13 (0–0.5). The number of admission medications was associated with delirium [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04], ADEs (aOR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04), pressure ulcers (aOR 1.04, 95% CI:1.02–1.06), HFRS [adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 1.01, 95% CI:1.001–1.02] and increased LOS (aRR 1.011, 95% CI: 1.008–1.014). The AUC DBI/days was associated with falls (aOR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18–1.41), delirium (aOR 1.63, 95% CI:1.46–1.82), ADEs (aOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11–1.43), pressure ulcers (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.38–1.86), HFRS (aRR 1.27, 95% CI:1.17–1.37) and increased LOS (aRR 1.36, 95% CI:1.32–1.40). Conclusion Polypharmacy is common amongst older surgical inpatients, and the number of medications increased from admission to discharge. Increased DBI exposure was associated with adverse outcomes.

Tools for Are Primary Health Care Visits Associated With Reduced Risk of Hospital Readmissions After Discharge From Geriatric Inpatient Departments? Evidence From Stockholm County.

Are Primary Health Care Visits Associated With Reduced Risk of Hospital Readmissions After Discharge From Geriatric Inpatient Departments? Evidence From Stockholm County.
By:Naseer, Mahwish;Willers, Carl;Boström, Anne-Marie;+4 moreIn:Journal of Primary Care & Community Health, 08/09/2024, pages 1-7 (7p)CINAHL
Introduction/objectives: Primary health care visits post-discharge could potentially play an important role in efforts of reducing hospital readmission. Focusing on a single or a particular type of visit obscures nuances in types of primary care contacts over time and fails to quantify the intensity of primary health care visits during the follow-up period. The aim of this study was to explore associations between the number and type of primary health care visits post-discharge and the risk of hospital readmission within 30 days. Methods: A register-based closed cohort study. The study population of 6135 individuals were residents of Stockholm who were discharged home from any of the 3 geriatric inpatient departments, excluding those who were readmitted within the next 24 h. The dependent variable was hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. The key independent variable was the number and type of primary health care visits in 30 days post-discharge. Cox-regression with time-varying covariates was employed for data analyses. Results: Approximately, 12% of the participants were readmitted to hospital within 30 days. There was no statistically significant association between number of primary care visits post-discharge and readmission (HR 1.00; 95% CI 1.00-1.01). Compared to no primary health care visit, no statistically significant association were found for administrative care related visits (HR 0.33, 95%CI 0.08-1.33), clinic visits (HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.71-1.21), home visits (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.84-1.27), or team visits (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.54-1.07). Conclusions: There were no associations between primary health care visits post-discharge and hospital readmission after geriatric inpatient care. Further studies using survey or qualitative approaches can provide insights into the factors that are relevant to post-discharge care but are unavailable in this type of register data studies.

Objectives: Falls with fracture in hospitalised patients remain a common occurrence with significant morbidity and mortality. Our objectives were to determine the characteristics of patients who suffer falls with fractures in hospital, and to examine whether outcomes in this cohort differ from those of patients who fall without sustaining a fracture. Methods: Coding data pertaining to a 6‐year period (2012–2017) were interrogated. Patients coded as having suffered a fall in hospital during this period were identified and divided into those who did and those who did not suffer fractures due to their fall. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared between groups and outcome measures examined with descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Results: From 236,720 inpatient admissions, 721 falls were recorded, 128 of which were associated with a fracture. Delirium (30% in those who suffered a fracture vs. 21% in those who did not, p < 0.040), dementia (23% vs. 13%, p < 0.004), female sex (53% vs. 44%, p < 0.020) and older age (76.8 vs. 72.8 years, p < 0.010) were associated with falls with fractures in hospital. Falls with fractures were associated with a longer length of inpatient stay by 9.2 days (95% CI 5.5–12.9, p < 0.001) and were an independent predictor of inpatient mortality. Conclusions: Greater understanding of characteristics of patients at risk of falls with fractures, as well as knowledge of the considerable associated morbidity and mortality, will help to prognosticate when these events occur and, potentially, to put preventative measures in place.

The Effect of Earplugs and Eye Masks on the Melatonin and Cortisol Levels of Patients Hospitalized in Cardiac Critical Care Units.
By:Noroziani, Saeideh I.;Esmaeili, Maryam;Cheraghi, Mohammad A.In:Critical Care Nursing Quarterly, Jan-Mar2025, volume 48, issue 1, pages 59-65 (7p)CINAHL
To determine the effectiveness of using earplugs and eye masks on the melatonin and cortisol levels of patients hospitalized in cardiac critical care units (CCUs). The research population of this study included all patients with acute coronary syndrome hospitalized in the CCU of Shahid Rajaei Hospital affiliated with to Alborz University of Medical Sciences. A total of 60 patients were selected by the available sampling method based on the inclusion criteria and then were divided into 2 control and intervention groups by block randomization method with blocks of 4 (n = 30 in the intervention group, and n = 30 in the control group). Patients in the intervention groups used blindfolds and earmuffs during the night sleep for 3 nights, but patients in the control group received the routine care. Cortisol and melatonin levels of both groups were measured at 8 am, using the urine samples. The findings of the 2 groups were compared and statistically analyzed by SPSS software version 16. The findings showed no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of demographic characteristics and clinical variables. The intervention had no effect on the cortisol level of patients in the intervention group (P = .24). After the intervention, a statistically significant difference was observed between the control and intervention groups in terms of the melatonin level in the nocturnal urine (P ≤ .001). A statistically significant difference was also observed between the 2 groups in terms of the time taken for patients to fall asleep (P ≤ .001) and the number of times waking up at night (P ≤ .001). The use of earplugs and eye masks had no impact on the level of cortisol hormone, but it affected the level of melatonin hormone and the sleep quality of patients hospitalized in the CCU.

Effectiveness of exercise intervention on physical and health outcomes in patients admitted to an acute medical ward: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
By:McCaig, Jane L;Gordon, Brett A;Taylor, Carolyn JIn:Clinical Rehabilitation, Jul2024, volume 38, issue 7, pages 884-897 (14p)CINAHL
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of inpatient medical ward exercise on physical and health outcomes in adults compared with usual care. Data sources: Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched from inception to 20 April 2023. Review methods: Randomised-controlled trials in English that reported physical and health outcomes of adults who received an exercise intervention on an acute medical ward were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro and TESTEX scales. The GRADE rating assessed the quality of evidence to evaluate the certainty of effect. Meta-analyses were performed where possible. Results: Thirteen studies were included, with 1273 unique participants (mean [SD] age, 75.5 [11] years), which compared exercise intervention with usual care. Low quality evidence demonstrated a significant improvement in aerobic capacity ([MD], 1.39 m [95% CI, 0.23, 2.55], p = 0.02) and maximum isometric strength ([MD], 2.3 kg [95% CI, 2.2, 2.4], p < 0.001) for the exercise intervention compared with usual care. Low quality evidence demonstrated no difference for in-hospital falls count ([OR], 1.93 [95% CI, 0.61, 6.12] p = 0.27) or mortality ([OR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.48, 1.23], p = 0.27). Moderate quality evidence demonstrated no difference for length of stay ([MD], −0.10 days [95% CI, −0.31, 0.11] p = 0.36). Conclusion: Exercise prescribed during an acute medical ward stay improves aerobic capacity and maximum isometric strength but may not reduce length of stay, in-hospital falls or mortality.

Aim: To investigate the impact of family visit restrictions during the COVID‐19 pandemic on deliriums, falls, pneumonia, pressure ulcers and readmissions among surgical inpatients with gastrointestinal (oncologic) diseases. Design: Cohort study. Methods: This study was conducted among adult inpatients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery in two academic hospitals. During the COVID‐19 outbreak in 2020, over a 10‐week period, one cohort was subjected to family visit restrictions. Per patient, one person per day was allowed to visit for a maximum of 30 min. This cohort was compared with another cohort in which patients were not subjected to such restrictions during a 10‐week period in 2019. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the impact of the restrictions on deliriums, falls, pneumonia, pressure ulcers and readmissions. Results: In total, 287 patients were included in the 2020 cohort and 243 in the 2019 cohort. No differences were observed in the cohorts with respect to baseline characteristics. Logistic regression analyses showed no significant differences in deliriums, falls, pneumonia, pressure ulcers and readmissions between the cohorts. Conclusion: We cautiously conclude that the family visit restrictions during the COVID‐19 pandemic did not contribute to deliriums, falls, pneumonia, pressure ulcers or readmissions in surgical patients with gastrointestinal (oncologic) diseases. Impact COVID‐19 influenced family‐centred care due to family visit restrictions. Nurses need to continue monitoring outcomes known to be sensitive to family‐centred care to gain insight into the effects of visit restrictions and share the results in order to include nurses' perspectives in COVID‐19‐decision‐making. Re‐implementing of family visit restrictions should be carefully considered in policy‐making.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of scaling advanced care at home (ACAH) (otherwise known as hospital at home) within an integrated health care delivery system. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients qualified for hospital-level care who were admitted to either ACAH or a traditional hospital. METHODS: From April 29, 2020, to November 14, 2021, patients requiring hospital-level care received Kaiser Permanente at Home or traditional hospital care. In a subgroup of patients, we compared outcomes for Kaiser Permanente at Home vs traditional hospital care using regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1005 patients were admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home. Average daily census (ADC) was intentionally increased over time in stages, from 7.2 to 8.8, then to 12.7. The maximum daily census was 22, with a peak ADC of 16, representing 9% of the total hospital inpatient medicine service census. During this time, there were numeric decreases in Kaiser Permanente at Home escalation rates (17.5% to 10.8%), median length of stay (7.43 days to 5.46 days), and readmission rates (9.79% to 9.24%). A subgroup of Kaiser Permanente at Home patients contributed to the comparative analyses, which showed that patients admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home were 64% less likely to experience delirium than patients admitted for traditional hospital care (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88; P = .026). Comparisons of quality metrics across stages of implementation (readmissions, escalations, length of stay) were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: In an integrated delivery system, ACAH care can be scaled and can create hospital capacity. However, our data were inconclusive regarding quality throughout scaling due to the small effective sample size, necessitating replication in a larger prospective study with adequate power/precision.

Tools for Post‐lockdown burden of road injury involving hospitalisation in Victoria, Australia: A statewide, population‐based time series analysis.

Post‐lockdown burden of road injury involving hospitalisation in Victoria, Australia: A statewide, population‐based time series analysis.
By:Lim, AndyIn:Emergency Medicine Australasia, Oct2024, volume 36, issue 5, pages 716-725 (10p)CINAHL
Objectives: Ever since COVID‐19, short‐term changes in transport injury patterns have been observed. The aim is to examine both the initial and the enduring impact of government lockdown and the pandemic on road injuries requiring hospitalisation and road fatalities. Methods: Time series analysis of Transport Accident Commission (TAC) claims involving hospitalisation and fatalities in Victoria, Australia, from July 2016 to May 2023, including lockdown (March 2020 to October 2020) and post‐lockdown (November 2020 onwards). Results: A total of 46 450 TAC claims were included. Average claims during the pre‐pandemic period were 652/month. Lockdown restrictions were associated with a statistically significant fall in monthly claims (−255, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −315 to −194, P < 0.01). This was consistent across road users, days of the week, hours of the day, injury severity, sex and central versus rural locations. The post‐lockdown period had a statistically significant reduction in monthly claims to 76% (95% CI = 67–84) of pre‐pandemic levels (−158, 95% CI = −213 to −102, P <0.01). This was consistent across all subgroups except bicyclist injuries, which remained constant (−8, 95% CI = −16 to 0, P = 0.05). There was a significant upward trend in the fatality‐to‐claim ratio post‐lockdown (0.001, 95% CI = 0–0.001, P <0.01). Conclusion: Road injury requiring hospitalisation decreased significantly during governmental lockdown and has returned to three‐quarters of pre‐pandemic levels (except bicyclist injuries that have remained constant), but there is an increasingly disproportionate number of fatalities. This represents a new baseline of injury burden for EDs and hospitals that manage trauma patients.

Objective: To determine whether Latino undocumented immigrants had a steeper decline in Emergency Department (ED) utilization compared to Latino Medi-Cal patients in a Los Angeles safety-net hospital, March 13, 2020, to May 8, 2020. Study Design: The data were extracted from patient medical records for ED visits at LAC + USC Medical Center from January 2018 to September 2020. We analyzed weekly ED encounters among undocumented Latino patients in the nine-week period after COVID was declared a national emergency. We applied time-series routines to identify and remove autocorrelation in ED encounters before examining its relation with the COVID-19 pandemic. We included Latino patients 18 years of age and older who were either on restricted or full-scope Medi-Cal (n = 230,195). Results: All low-income Latino patients, regardless of immigration status, experienced a significant decline in ED utilization during the first nine weeks of the pandemic. Undocumented patients, however, experienced an even steeper decline. ED visits for this group fall below expected levels between March 13, 2020, and May 8, 2020 (coef. = − 38.67; 95% CI = − 71.71, − 5.63). When applied to the weekly mean of ED visits, this translates to a 10% reduction below expected levels in ED visits during this time period. Conclusion: Undocumented immigrants' health care utilization was influenced by external events that occurred early in the pandemic, such as strict stay-at-home orders and the public charge rule change. Health care institutions and local policy efforts could work to ensure that hospitals are safer spaces for undocumented immigrants to receive care without immigration concerns.

Background: New-onset insomnia and other sleep disturbances occur more frequently in the inpatient setting due to a variety of physical and psychological factors. Studies have found that non-pharmacologic interventions can be effective in treating insomnia in the inpatient setting, particularly in the ICU, to prevent adverse outcomes, but further research is needed to identify optimal pharmacologic interventions. Objective: To compare treatment outcomes of patients initiated on melatonin and trazodone to treat new-onset insomnia in non-ICU hospitalized patients based on the need for an additional sleep aid therapy during hospitalization and to compare the rate of adverse events of each agent. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for adult patients admitted to a non-ICU general medicine or surgical floor at a community teaching hospital between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. Patients were included if they were initiated on scheduled melatonin or trazodone for the treatment of new onset insomnia during their hospitalization. Patients were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of insomnia, were prescribed 2 sleep aids simultaneously, or if their admission medication reconciliation included pharmacologic treatment for insomnia. Clinical data collected included non-pharmacologic interventions, sleep aid dose, number of doses of sleep aid administered, and total number of nights an additional sleep aid was needed. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients needing additional therapy defined as, administering an additional sleep aid between 2100-0600 or utilizing more than 1 sleep aid agent during hospitalization compared between melatonin and trazodone. Secondary outcomes of this study included the rate of adverse events such as difficulty awakening, daytime sleepiness, serotonin syndrome, falls, and development of in hospital delirium. Results: Of 158 included patients, 132 received melatonin and 26 received trazodone. Male sex (53.8% [melatonin] vs. 53.8% [trazodone]; P = 1), hospital length of stay (7.7 vs 7.7 days; P =.68), and administration of drugs that could cause insomnia (34.1% vs 23.1%vs; P =.27) were similar between sleep aids. Percentage of patients needing an additional sleep aid during hospitalization (19.7% vs 34.6%; P =.09), and patients prescribed a sleep aid at discharge (39.4% vs 46.2%; P =.52) were similar between sleep aids, respectively. Rates of adverse events were similar between sleep aids. Conclusions: There was no significant difference between the 2 agents in terms of the primary outcome, even though a higher rate of patients treated with trazodone for new-onset insomnia during hospitalization required an additional sleep aid compared to those treated with melatonin. No difference in adverse events was observed.

Tools for Validation of nursing documentation regarding in-hospital falls: a cohort study.

Validation of nursing documentation regarding in-hospital falls: a cohort study.
By:Krakau, Karolina;Andersson, Helene;Dahlin, Åsa Franzén;+3 moreIn:BMC Nursing, 09/04/2021, volume 20, issue 1, pages 1-9 (9p)CINAHL
Background: In-hospital fall incidents are common and sensitive to nursing care. It is therefore important to have easy access to valid patient data to evaluate and follow-up nursing care. The aim of the study was to validate the nursing documentation, using a specific term in the registered nurses´ (RNs´) discharge note, regarding inpatient falls according to the outcome of a digitalized data extraction tool and the discharge note itself. Methods: At a teaching hospital, 31,571 episodes of care were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective cohort study. A stratified sampling including five groups was used, two with random sampling and three with total sampling. In total, 1232 episodes of care were reviewed in the electronic patient record using a study-specific protocol. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: In total, 590 episodes of care in the study cohort included 714 falls. When adjusted for the stratified sampling the cumulative incidence for the study population was 1.9%. The positive predictive value in total for the data extraction tool regarding the presence of any fall, in comparison with the record review, was 87.4%. Discrepancies found were, for example, that the RNs, at discharge, stated that the patient had fallen but no documented evidence of that could be detected during admission. It could also be the opposite, that the RNs correctly had documented that no fall had occurred, but the data extraction tool made an incorrect selection. When the latter had been withdrawn, the positive predictive value was 91.5%. Information about minor injuries due to the fall was less accurate. In the group where RNs had stated that the patient had fallen without injury, minor injuries had actually occurred in 28.3% of the episodes of care. Conclusions: The use of a specific term regarding fall in the RNs´ discharge note seems to be a valid and reliable data measurement and can be used continuously to evaluate and follow-up nursing care.

Tools for Caídas en ancianos hospitalizados en cuatro centros de alta complejidad de Colombia. Descripción clínica y complicaciones.

Caídas en ancianos hospitalizados en cuatro centros de alta complejidad de Colombia. Descripción clínica y complicaciones.
By:Machado-Duque, Manuel E.;Camacho-Arteaga, Lina;Sabaté, Mónica;+1 moreIn:Enfermería Clínica, Jul2024, volume 34, issue 4, pages 302-311 (10p)CINAHL
La incidencia de caídas en pacientes ancianos dentro del ambiente hospitalario es tres veces superior a la que se presenta en la comunidad. Se planteó el objetivo de determinar las características de pacientes que sufrieron caídas intrahospitalarias y sus complicaciones en cuatro clínicas de Colombia. Estudio transversal con pacientes ≥ 65 años de edad, ingresados entre 2018 y 2020 en cuatro clínicas de Colombia, que presentaron una caída durante su estancia. Se revisaron datos clínicos, motivos de la caída, complicaciones y uso de medicamentos de riesgo conocido para generar caídas y con carga anticolinérgica. Se identificaron 249 pacientes, con edad media de 77,5 ± 7,4 años y predominio masculino (63,9%), internados principalmente por neumonía adquirida en comunidad (12,4%) y falla cardiaca (10,4%); las caídas ocurrieron más frecuentemente en los servicios de hospitalización (77,1%) y urgencias (20,9%). Se relacionaron con procesos de bipedestación en solitario (34,4%) y movilización al baño (28,9%), con traumatismo en el 40,6% (n = 102), especialmente de cabeza (27,7%), y baja incidencia de fracturas (3,2%). El 92% de casos tenían polifarmacia ≥ 5 medicamentos, el 88% recibieron psicofármacos y el 37,3%, medicamentos con carga anticolinérgica ≥ 3 puntos. Los adultos mayores de 65 años internados sufrieron caídas, principalmente en los servicios de hospitalización y urgencias, en especial durante el proceso de deambulación en solitario. La mayoría habían recibido psicofármacos y medicamentos con alta carga anticolinérgica. Estos resultados sugieren que es necesario mejorar las estrategias de prevención de riesgo de este tipo de eventos. The incidence of falls in elderly patients in the hospital environment is three times higher than that in the community. The aim was to determine the characteristics of patients who suffered in-hospital falls and their complications. This was a cross-sectional study with patients ≥ 65 years old, admitted between 2018 and 2020 to four clinics in Colombia who presented a fall during their stay. Clinical data, reasons for the fall, complications and use of drugs with a known risk for causing falls and with an anticholinergic load were reviewed. A total of 249 patients were included. The mean age was 77.5 ± 7.4 years, and there was a predominance of males (63.9%). The patients were hospitalized mainly for community-acquired pneumonia (12.4%) and heart failure (10.4%). Falls occurred most frequently in hospitalization wards (77.1%) and emergency departments (20.9%). Falls were related to standing alone (34.4%) and on the way to the bathroom (28.9%), with 40.6% (n = 102) of falls resulting in trauma, especially to the head (27.7%); the incidence of fractures was low (3.2%). Ninety-two percent of patients had polypharmacy (≥ 5 drugs), 88.0% received psychotropic drugs, and 37.3% received drugs with an anticholinergic load ≥ 3 points. Hospitalized adults ≥ 65 years old suffered falls, mainly in hospitalization wards and emergency departments, especially during the process of solitary ambulation. Most had received psychotropic drugs and medications with a high anticholinergic load. These results suggest that it is necessary to improve risk prevention strategies for falls in this population.

Tools for Evaluation of a Multisite Nurse-Led Mobility Plan.

Evaluation of a Multisite Nurse-Led Mobility Plan.
By:Workman, Charlie A.;Davies, Claire C.;Ogle, Karen C.;+2 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Administration (JONA), Dec2020, volume 50, issue 12, pages 649-654 (6p)CINAHL
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of nurses' mobility plan use on patients' length of stay, discharge destination, falls, physical therapy consults, and nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding patient mobility. BACKGROUND: Functional decline due to decreased mobility during hospitalization results in diminished quality of life. Sixty-five percent of older inpatients lose the ability to ambulate during hospitalization and 30% do not regain that capability. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, nurses' use of a mobility assessment on 4 patient outcome variables was examined before (n = 2,259) and after (n = 3,649) use. Nurses' attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding mobility were also examined. RESULTS: Positive changes in patient variables occurred. Limited change occurred relative to nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a nurse-led mobility plan enhances therapy resource utilization through identification of appropriate consults and improves patients' discharge home. In addition, nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward patient mobility planning can be positively influenced.

Tools for The impact of nursing skill-mix on adverse events in intensive care: a single centre cohort study.

The impact of nursing skill-mix on adverse events in intensive care: a single centre cohort study.
By:Ross, Paul;Hodgson, Carol L.;Ilic, Dragan;+6 moreIn:Contemporary Nurse: A Journal for the Australian Nursing Profession, Feb023, volume 59, issue 1, pages 3-15 (13p)CINAHL
The highly complex and technological environment of critical care manages the most critically unwell patients in the hospital system, as such there is a need for a highly trained nursing workforce. Intensive care is considered a high-risk area for errors and adverse events (AE) due to the severity of illness and number of procedures performed. To investigate if the percentage of Critical Care Registered Nurses (CCRN) within an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is associated with an increased risk of patients experiencing an AE. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between January 2016 and December 2020 to a tertiary ICU in Australia. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to investigate the relationship between the proportion of CCRNs each month and the occurrence of an AE defined as any one of a medication error, fall, pressure injury or unplanned removal of a central venous catheter or endotracheal tube per patient. A total of 13,560 patients were included in the study, with 854 (6.3%) experiencing one AE. Patients with an AE were associated with higher illness severity and frailty scores. They were more commonly admitted after medical emergency team response calls and were less commonly elective ICU admissions. Those with an AE had longer ICU and in-hospital length of stay, and higher ICU and in-hospital mortality, on average. After adjusting for ICU LOS and acute severity of illness, being admitted during a month of higher critical care nursing skill-mix was associated with a statistically significant lower odds of having a subsequent AE (OR 0.966 [95% CI: 0.944–0.988], p 0.003). An increasing percentage of CCRNs is independently associated with a lower risk-adjusted likelihood of an AE. Increasing the skill-mix of the ICU nursing staff may reduce the occurrence of AEs and lead to improved patient outcomes.

Tools for Risk Factors of Readmissions in Geriatric Rehabilitation Patients: RESORT.

Risk Factors of Readmissions in Geriatric Rehabilitation Patients: RESORT.
By:Wan, Ching S.;Reijnierse, Esmee M.;Maier, Andrea B.In:Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Aug2021, volume 102, issue 8, pages 1524-1532 (9p)CINAHL
To evaluate the risk factors associated with 30- and 90-day hospital readmissions in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. Observational, prospective longitudinal inception cohort. Tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Geriatric rehabilitation inpatients of the REStORing Health of Acutely Unwell AdulTs (RESORT) cohort evalutated by a comprehensive geriatric assessment including potential readmission risk factors (ie, demographic, social support, lifestyle, functional performance, quality of life, morbidity, length of stay in an acute ward). Of 693 inpatients, 11 died during geriatric rehabilitation. The mean age of the remaining 682 inpatients was 82.2±7.8 years, and 56.7% were women. Not applicable. Thirty- and 90-day readmissions after discharge from geriatric inpatient rehabilitation. The 30- and 90-day unplanned all-cause readmission rates were 11.6% and 25.2%, respectively. Risk factors for 30- and 90-day readmissions were as follows: did not receive tertiary education, lower quality of life, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) scores, and a higher number of medications used in the univariable models. Formal care was associated with increased risk for 90-day readmissions. In multivariable models, CIRS score was a significant risk factor for 30-day readmissions, whereas high fear of falling and CIRS score were significant risk factors for 90-day readmissions. High fear of falling and CIRS score were independent risk factors for readmission in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. These variables should be included in hospital readmission risk prediction model developments for geriatric rehabilitation inpatients.

Tools for Reducing Unwitnessed Falls on a Medical-Surgical Unit.

Reducing Unwitnessed Falls on a Medical-Surgical Unit.
By:Wisler, Hannah;Prado, Gabriel;Cohn, TanyaIn:MEDSURG Nursing, May/Jun2021, volume 30, issue 3, pages 208-211 (4p)CINAHL
Literature Summary * Falls are preventable events (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020). * The National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators reported the national average for falls by medical-surgical patients as 3.92 per 1,000 patient days (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2017). * Effective fall prevention requires a partnership between the patient and staff that respects the patient's wishes. Patients agreed with the fall prevention plan described by the nurse when they understood why it was necessary (Uymaz & Nahcivan, 2016). * Nurse-led fall prevention education focused on fall risk behaviors and knowledge of fall risk medications resulted in an almost 50% reduction in falls (Uymaz & Nahcivan, 2016). CQI Model Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) (The W. Edwards Deming Institute, n.d.) Quality Indicator with Operational Definitions & Data Collection Method Unwitnessed fall was defined as a fall that occurred without a staff member present. Number of unwitnessed falls per month was collected pre-implementation (April-June 2019); 1-month washout period during the implementation phase (July 2019); and post-implementation of a fall safety contract with fall prevention education (August-October 2019). Clinical Setting/Patient Population/Average Daily Census 22-bed medical-surgical unit in an urban 342-bed nonprofit hospital in the northeastern United States; average daily census 19 patients (range 15-22 due to admissions and discharges) ages 18-100+. Majority of admissions were surgical patients requiring preoperative and postoperative care. Program Objective Decrease the number of unwitnessed falls by 50%.

Tools for Combining the AM-PAC "6-Clicks" and the Morse Fall Scale to Predict Individuals at Risk for Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospital.

Combining the AM-PAC "6-Clicks" and the Morse Fall Scale to Predict Individuals at Risk for Falls in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospital.
By:Lohse, Keith R.;Dummer, Danica R.;Hayes, Heather A.;+2 moreIn:Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Dec2021, volume 102, issue 12, pages 2309-2315 (7p)CINAHL
To determine the effect of adding the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) Inpatient '6-Clicks' Short Forms to the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) to assess fall risk. Falls that occur in a rehabilitation hospital result in increased morbidity and mortality, increased cost, and negatively affect reimbursement. Identifying individuals at high risk for falls would enable targeted fall prevention strategies and facilitate appropriate resource allocation to address this critical patient safety issue. We used a retrospective observational design and repeated k-fold cross-validation (10 repeats and 10 folds) of logistic regression models with falls regressed onto: MFS alone, AM-PAC basic mobility and applied cognitive scales alone, and MFS and AM-PAC combined. Inpatient rehabilitation hospital. After exclusions, 2007 patients from an inpatient setting (N=2007; 131 experienced a fall). Primary diagnoses included 602 individuals with stroke (30%), 502 with brain injury (25%), 321 with spinal cord injury (16%), and 582 with other diagnoses (29%). Not applicable. Experience of a fall during inpatient stay. The MFS at admission was associated with falls (area under the curve [AUC], 0.64). Above and beyond the MFS, AM-PAC applied cognitive and basic mobility at admission were also significantly associated with falls (combined model AUC, 0.70). Although MFS and applied cognition showed linear associations, there was evidence for a nonlinear association with AM-PAC basic mobility. The AM-PAC basic mobility and AM-PAC applied cognitive scales showed associations with falls above and beyond the MFS. More work is needed to validate model predictions in an independent sample with truly longitudinal data; prediction accuracy would also need to be substantially improved. However, the current data do suggest that the AM-PAC has the potential to reduce the burden of fall management by focusing resources on a smaller cohort of patients identified as having a high fall risk.

Tools for The acceptability and accessibility of magnetic walking aids when used in hospital: a randomised trial.

The acceptability and accessibility of magnetic walking aids when used in hospital: a randomised trial.
By:Roberts, Alexander K. G.;Kane, Cody;Allen, Natalie E.In:Disability & Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, Aug2024, volume 19, issue 6, pages 2190-2197 (8p)CINAHL
Poor walking aid compliance and accessibility can put the user at an increased risk of falls. We explored the acceptability and accessibility of magnetic walking aids (MWAs) compared to standard walking aids (SWAs) in inpatients following joint replacement. A non-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted. Inpatients following hip or knee replacement were randomly allocated to the MWA group (n = 20) or the SWA group (n = 20). Primary outcomes were the acceptability and accessibility of the MWA compared to the SWA during their inpatient stay, assessed through made-to-measure patient and staff questionnaires. The secondary outcome was the number of times the walking aid came to rest on the floor, measured using logbooks kept by participants. The participants in the MWA group reported their aid was more easily accessible, and that they were more likely to use their aid in their room than participants in the SWA group. Participants in the MWA group dropped their aid less often, with a median of 0.3 walking aid drops per day in the MWA group and 1.1 drops per day in the SWA group (p = 0.002). The results of this pilot randomised trial suggest MWAs may be an acceptable and inexpensive intervention for improving walking aid accessibility and adherence and reducing walking aid drops when compared to SWAs. Magnetic walking aids may be a simple and cost effective way for improving walking aid compliance compared to standard walking aids. Walking aid adherence can be difficult to monitor within hospital and community settings. Magnetic walking aids may be safe to use in a controlled inpatient hospital environment with no adverse effects. Magnetic walking aids may reduce the number of instances a walking aid inadvertently comes to rest on the floor. This is of particular importance to patients post-operatively. For example, total hip replacements, where reaching to pick up an aid from the floor could lead to hip dislocation.

Tools for Comparison of the psychometric properties of three commonly used fall risk assessment tools: a prospective observational study for stroke patients.

Comparison of the psychometric properties of three commonly used fall risk assessment tools: a prospective observational study for stroke patients.
By:Arslan, Özge;Tosun, ZeynepIn:Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, Sep2022, volume 29, issue 6, pages 430-437 (8p)CINAHL
A reliable tool recommendation is needed to identify the risk of falling in hospitalized stroke patients. The aim of this study was to identify the most reliable fall risk assessment tool among the Morse Fall Scale (MFS), Itaki Fall Risk Scale (Itaki FRS) and Hendrich II Fall Risk Model (HIIFRM) for stroke patients. The study was planned as an observational prospective study. It was carried out over the period July-December 2018 with 125 stroke patients. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Itaki FRS, HIIFRM, and MFS were used for the study data. The fall risk and incidents of falling were monitored on a daily basis over the course of the patients' stay at the hospital. The differentiation between the fall risk tools was assessed with sensitivity-specificity analysis and the ROC curve. The mean age of the research participants was 71.47 ± 11.16 years. It was determined that 9.6% of the patients fell at least once during the follow-up period, which was 8.66 ± 1.80 days on average. The sensitivity and specificity rates of the fall risk assessment tools were respectively 75.0% and 63.7% for the Itaki FRS, 83.3% and 50.4% for the HIIFRM, and 91.7% and 73.5% for the MFS. The cutoff points on the tools were 14 for the Itaki FRS, 4.5 for the HIIFRM, and 66.2 for the MFS. MFS is a more reliable tool than Itaki FRS or HIIFRM in determining fall risk in hospitalized stroke patients.

Increased number of deaths within 24 h of admission during a period of social restriction related to the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective service evaluation in a metropolitan palliative care unit.
By:Everitt, Rachel;Robinson, Neil;Marco, David;+2 moreIn:Palliative Medicine, Sep2021, volume 35, issue 8, pages 1508-1513 (6p)CINAHL
Background: COVID-19 has led to implementation of wide-ranging social restriction measures with consequent impact on health care utilisation in many domains. There is little published data on the experience of palliative care services catering to a population with low case numbers of COVID-19. Aim: This study aimed to consider the impact of COVID-19 on utilisation of inpatient palliative care in the context of low community transmission, and low numbers of cases in hospital. Design: A retrospective service evaluation examining differences in number of admissions, diagnoses, number of deaths and time from admission to death, across three discrete 8-week time periods spanning the early COVID-19 pandemic. Setting/participants: All admissions (n = 194) to a metropolitan tertiary hospital inpatient palliative care unit in Melbourne during the study period. Results: An initial 16.9% fall in admissions was followed by a return to baseline admission numbers, with a 46.7% increase in number of deaths compared to baseline. The number of deaths within 24 h rose from 10.8% to 37.3% (p < 0.01). The number of patients with non-malignant diagnoses increased from 32.4% to 52%, and those with non-malignant diagnoses were more likely to die rapidly (p < 0.01). There were no patients with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Increased numbers of deaths within 24 h of admission occurred on the palliative care unit despite low COVID-19 case numbers in the wider community, and in the setting of widespread social restriction measures. More research is needed examining the health-related consequences of such restrictions for individuals not infected with COVID-19.

Impact of the Lockdown Due to COVID-19 Pandemic on the Spectrum and Outcome of Trauma in India.
By:Hazra, Darpanarayan;Jindal, Anmol;Fernandes, Joanna P.;+1 moreIn:Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine, Mar2021, volume 25, issue 3, pages 273-277 (5p)CINAHL
Background: As a pre-emptive measure against the rampaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), the Government of India ordered an unprecedented but imperative step of a nationwide lockdown on 22nd March, 2020. The entire month of April 2020 remained in a complete national lockdown. Methodology: We conducted this retrospective study to compare the spectrum and outcome of trauma victims who presented to our emergency department (ED) from April 2020 (lockdown period) to a similar season matched control arm of April 2018 (non-lockdown period). Results: Our study groups included 403 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 9.7%) from April 2020 as compared to 667 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 10.8%) from April 2018 with an absolute decrease of -39.6% during the lockdown month. The intense lockdown resulted in an absolute decrease in the number of road traffic accidents (RTA) (-75.1%), sports-related injuries (-81.8%), bull gore injuries (-64.3%), workplacerelated injuries (-50.0%), and fall from height (-3.5%). However, an absolute increase in the number of falls on level ground (FLG) (+95.7%), domestic trauma (+91.4%), and burn (+37.5%) patients were noted during the lockdown period. The proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, as determined by a positive blood alcohol content, was significantly lower in the lockdown period (adjusted OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.17-0.67); p-value: 0.002) as were RTAs (adjusted OR: 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31-0.62); p-value: <0.001), FLG (adjusted OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.14-3.06); p-value: 0.0), and head injuries (adjusted OR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13-0.3); p-value: <0.001). Conclusion: During the stringent lockdown period of April 2020, there was a significant absolute decrease in the number of trauma victims, especially RTAs. The intense lockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, head injuries, fractures, and dislocations.

Tools for Reduction of care-relevant risks to older patients during and after acute hospital care (ReduRisk) - study protocol of a cluster randomized efficacy trial in a stepped wedge design.

Reduction of care-relevant risks to older patients during and after acute hospital care (ReduRisk) - study protocol of a cluster randomized efficacy trial in a stepped wedge design.
By:Göhner, Anne;Dreher, Elena;Kentischer, Felix;+10 moreIn:BMC Geriatrics, 09/15/2022, volume 22, issue 1, pages 1-13 (13p)CINAHL
Background: Older patients are at an increased risk of hospitalization, negatively affecting their health and quality of life. Such patients also experience a lack of physical activity during their inpatient stay, as well as being at increased risk of delirium and inappropriate prescribing. These risk factors can accumulate, promoting a degree of morbidity and the development of cognitive impairment.Methods: Through the ReduRisk-program, patients at risk of functional impairment, immobility, falls, delirium or re-hospitalization shortly after hospital discharge, will be identified via risk-screening. These patients will receive an individually tailored, multicomponent and risk-adjusted prevention program. The trial will compare the effectiveness of the ReduRisk-program against usual care in a stepped-wedge-design, with quarterly cluster randomization of six university hospital departments into intervention and control groups. 612 older adults aged 70 years or more are being recruited. Patients in the intervention cluster (n = 357) will receive the ReduRisk-program, comprising risk-adjusted delirium management, structured mobility training and digitally supported planning of post-inpatient care, including polypharmacy management. This study will evaluate the impact of the ReduRisk-program on the primary outcomes of activities of daily living and mobility, and the secondary outcomes of delirium, cognition, falls, grip strength, health-related quality of life, potentially inappropriate prescribing, health care costs and re-hospitalizations. Assessments will be conducted at inpatient admission (t0), at discharge (t1) and at six months post-discharge (t2). In the six-month period following discharge, a health-economic evaluation will be carried out based on routine health insurance data (t3).Discussion: Despite the importance of multicomponent, risk-specific approaches to managing older patients, guidelines on their effectiveness are lacking. This trial will seek to provide evidence for the effectiveness of a multicomponent, risk-adjusted prevention program for older patients at risk of functional impairment, immobility, falls, delirium and re-hospitalization. Positive study results would support efforts to improve multicomponent prevention and the management of older patients.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00025594, date of registration: 09/08/2021.

Individuals who fall from heights of ≥6 m can suffer from complex pelvic and acetabular fractures. The extent to which an intentional fall correlates with prognosis and outcome after osteosynthesis is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of fallers with pelvic and acetabular fractures after osteosynthesis and compare the radiological and functional outcomes between intentional and accidental fallers. We retrospectively reviewed 49 fallers who fell from heights of ≥6 m, developed pelvic and acetabular fractures, survived after resuscitation, and completed surgical treatment between 2014 and 2017. Fallers were divided into intentional and accidental fallers. Sixteen patients were intentional fallers, whereas the rest of the patients were accidental fallers. Psychiatric counseling was provided to each of the intentional fallers during follow-up. All intentional fallers had preexisting mental disorders, and the most common diagnosis was adjustment disorder. The group of intentional fallers predominantly comprised females that had a higher injury and new injury severity scores and longer hospital stays. However, early loss of fixation (<3 months) and functional outcomes (Merle d'Aubigné and Majeed hip scores at 6- and 12-month follow-ups) did not significantly differ between intentional and accidental fallers. We found that intentional fallers with pelvic and acetabular fractures may have more severe combined injuries compared to accidental fallers. However, the radiological and functional outcomes of the intentional fallers after osteosynthesis were not inferior to those of the accidental fallers with the implementation of well-designed surgical protocols and individualized physical and mental rehabilitation programs.

Tools for Retrospective Analysis of Factors Associated With a Revised Fall Prevention Bundle in Hospitalized Patients.

Retrospective Analysis of Factors Associated With a Revised Fall Prevention Bundle in Hospitalized Patients.
By:Scheidenhelm, Sandra;Astroth, Kim Schafer;DeLong, Karen;+2 moreIn:Journal of Nursing Administration (JONA), Nov2020, volume 50, issue 11, pages 571-577 (7p)CINAHL
Supplemental digital content is available in the text. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to describe factors associated and injuries sustained with inpatients who fell while hospitalized and identify the impact of a revised fall-prevention bundle. BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 million falls occur in hospitals annually, accounting for approximately 70% of inpatient accidents. Inpatient falls can result in physical injury, increased patient mortality and morbidity, decreased quality of life, and increased length of stay and cost. METHODS: We used a retrospective review of patient fall data for adult inpatients who fell while hospitalized. RESULTS: After reeducation and implementation of all elements of a revised fall-prevention bundle, there were fewer falls per patient day. We identified additional characteristics indicating when patients were more likely to be injured in a fall. CONCLUSIONS: A fall-prevention bundle is effective in decreasing inpatient falls and falls with injury. Raising awareness of additional factors may decrease risk of injuries during an inpatient fall.

Tools for The effect of the COVID pandemic lockdown measures on surgical emergencies: experience and lessons learned from a Greek tertiary hospital.

The effect of the COVID pandemic lockdown measures on surgical emergencies: experience and lessons learned from a Greek tertiary hospital.
By:Pikoulis, Emmanouil;Koliakos, Nikolaos;Papaconstantinou, Dimitrios;+8 moreIn:World Journal of Emergency Surgery, 07/05/2021, volume 16, issue 1, pages 1-8 (8p)CINAHL
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rise in healthcare demands leading to significant restructuring of hospital emergency departments worldwide. The aim of the present study is twofold: firstly, to discern any differences in regard to reason for surgical emergency department (SED) attendance and hospital admission during the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras in Greece, and secondly, to assess the impact of the lockdown measures implemented during the pandemic on SED patient attendance. Methods: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece (1 March 2020) and up to 15 December 2020, the charts of all adult patients arriving at the SED of the third surgical department of the "Attikon" University Hospital (a tertiary referral center for surgical and COVID-19 cases) were retrospectively reviewed and broken down in four periods reflecting two nationwide lockdown (period A 1/3/2020 to 30/4/2020 and period D 16/10/2020 to 15/12/2020) and two interim (period B 1/5/2020 to 15/6/2020 and period C 15/9/2020 to 30/10/2020) periods. Demographic and clinical data were compared to those obtained from the same time periods of the year 2019. Results: The total number of patients attending the SED decreased by 35.9% during the pandemic (from 2839 total patients in 2019 to 1819 in 2020). During the first lockdown, there was statistically significant reduction of motor vehicle accidents (p=0.04) and torso injuries (p=0.01). Contrarily, the rate of head injuries (p<0.001) and abdominal pain (p=0.04) were significantly increased. The same effect was observed regarding the rate of hospital admissions (p=0.002), although in terms of absolute numbers, admissions remained unchanged. During the second lockdown, there was a reduction in the number of perianal abscess cases (p=0.04) and hernia-related problems (p=0.001). An increase in the rate of fall injuries was also demonstrable (p=0.02). Overall, application of the lockdown led to a significant decrease in minor (p<0.001) and torso (p=0.001) injuries. Conclusion: The burden of the new COVID-19 disease has left a noticeable imprint in the function of emergency departments worldwide. In Greece, SED attendance was significantly reduced during the pandemic, an effect that was even more pronounced during the lockdown implementation; nevertheless, the overall rate of hospital admissions remained the same, denoting that patient care was not altered.

By:Zhang, Hong;Wang, Jiechu;Zhu, Sainan;+1 moreIn:Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Sep2022, volume 31, issue 17/18, pages 2584-2592 (9p)CINAHL
Background: Hypothermia is a common clinical issue during the perioperative period. The patients with perioperative inadvertent hypothermia are associated with higher risk of postoperative complications and higher hospitalisation costs. Aims: The aim of this study is to explore the prevalence of and predictors for hypothermia in patients entering postanaesthesia care unit. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: A rigorous retrospective cohort study was conducted according to the STROBE reporting checklist. A total of 7216 patients were enrolled in this study. The perioperative variables potentially related to hypothermia were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to investigate the contributing factors. Results: The overall prevalence of inadvertent hypothermia in postanaesthesia care unit was 21.3% (n = 1505). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age >65 (OR = 1.561, 95% CI 1.371–1.778, p <.001), non‐supine position [lateral decubitus position (OR = 1.341, 95% CI 1.133–1.586, p =.001), lithotomy position (OR = 1.639, 95% CI 1.295–2.075, p <.001)], non‐superficial surgery (OR = 2.195, 95% CI 1.566–3.077, p <.001), non‐open surgery [laparoscopic surgery (OR = 1.205, 95% CI 1.020–1.423, p =.029), endoscopic surgery (OR = 1.430, 95%CI 1.084–1.887, p =.011)], the volume of intravenous infusion fluid >1000 ml (OR = 1.814, 95% CI 1.500–2.194, p <.001), blood transfusion (OR = 1.552, 95% CI 1.159–2.078, p =.003), operation performed in the summer or fall (OR = 1.874, 95%CI 1.656–2.122, p <.001) and use of dexmedetomidine (OR = 1.147, 95%CI 1.015–1.296, p =.028) were associated with increased risk of hypothermia. In contrast, our finding showed that body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 (OR = 0.556, 95%CI 0.491–0.630, p <.001), higher baseline body temperature (OR = 0.641, 95%CI 0.541–0.761, p <.001) and duration of fasting ≥18 h (OR = 0.487, 95%CI 0.345–0.689, p <.001) were associated with decreased risk of hypothermia. Compared with non‐hypothermic patients, patients with hypothermia were associated with prolonged length of hospital days (5 vs. 4 days, p <.001). Conclusion: For patients admitted to postanaesthesia care unit after elective procedures, old age, non‐supine position, non‐open surgery, non‐superficial surgery, large volume of intravenous infusion fluid, dexmedetomidine, blood transfusion and Summer or Fall operative season were associated with increased risk of hypothermia, whereas high body mass index, high baseline body temperature and long fasting duration were associated with decreased risk of hypothermia. Relevance to clinical practice: The outcomes of this study will raise the concerns of perioperative care team on hypothermia in surgical patients. Measures should be taken to improve perioperative hypothermia and clinical outcome.

Tools for Clinical effect of pulmonary rehabilitation combined with diaphragm pacemaker therapy in the treatment of severely ill patients with mechanical ventilation.

Clinical effect of pulmonary rehabilitation combined with diaphragm pacemaker therapy in the treatment of severely ill patients with mechanical ventilation.
By:Liu, Zi-Bo;Wang, Lu-yi;Zhao, Long;+4 moreIn:International Journal of Rehabilitation Research, Sep2022, volume 45, issue 3, pages 195-200 (6p)CINAHL
To investigate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation combined with diaphragm pacemaker therapy on the diaphragm function of severely ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Forty patients were randomly divided into the control group (CG; n = 20) and experimental group (EG; n = 20). The CG was given basic ICU nursing and conventional rehabilitation treatment. The EG added a diaphragm pacemaker and pulmonary rehabilitation therapies along with basic ICU nursing and conventional rehabilitation treatment. The relevant indexes were compared at baseline and postintervention, including the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, diaphragm mobility and thickness. The indexes of mechanical ventilation time, ICU and total hospital stays were compared between the two groups. There was no difference in the GCS and APACHE II scores, and diaphragm mobility and thickness between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05). After 30 days of treatment, the GCS scores increased in both groups, the APACHE II scores decreased significantly, and diaphragm mobility and thickness decreased compared with before treatment (P < 0.05), but the improvement of each index in the EG was more evident than in the CG. Compared with the CG, the indexes of the EG, including offline, ICU and total hospitalization times, were significantly shorter (P < 0.05). Additionally, there were no adverse events such as accidental tube detachment or falling out of bed during treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation combined with a diaphragm pacemaker is safe and effective in treating severely ill mechanically ventilated patients.

Tools for Early predictors of discharge to home among severely injured geriatric patients: A single-system retrospective cohort study.

Early predictors of discharge to home among severely injured geriatric patients: A single-system retrospective cohort study.
By:Lai, Krista;Anantha, Ram V;Fawcett, Vanessa;+3 moreIn:Trauma, Apr2022, volume 24, issue 2, pages 154-163 (10p)CINAHL
Background: Injured geriatric patients experience significant functional decline during their hospitalization, limiting their ability to be discharged home which is a valuable outcome among this vulnerable population. We therefore sought to evaluate the clinical characteristics of injured elderly patients managed within our trauma system and identify early predictors for discharge to home. Methods: In this single-system retrospective cohort study, we evaluated significantly injured (Injury Severity Score ≥12) geriatric (age ≥65 y) patients admitted from Northern Alberta between 2011 and 2016. The primary outcome was discharge disposition to home. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: We identified 1548 patients with a median age of 77. Falls accounted for 47% of injuries with median injury severity score of 22; 47% of patients were discharged home with a median hospital length of stay of 8 days. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 19%. On multivariable regression, age, injury severity score, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Score were independent predictors for discharge home, as well as hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. Conclusion: Nearly half of severely injured geriatric trauma patients were discharged home. The identified predictors provide clues to disposition on admission that trauma providers may use to guide in-hospital care planning, disposition planning, and stimulate early goals of care discussions.

Outcomes improvement despite continuous visits of severely injured patients during the COVID-19 outbreak: experience at a regional trauma centre in South Korea.
By:Kang, Sooyeon;Park, Ji Eun;Ko, Ji Wool;+5 moreIn:BMC Emergency Medicine, 06/10/2022, volume 22, issue 1, pages 1-11 (11p)CINAHL
Background: Understanding the changes in characteristics of patients who visited trauma centres during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is important to facilitate aneffective response. This retrospective study was conducted to analyse differences in the characteristics and outcomes of patients who visited our trauma centre between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras.Methods: Medical data of trauma patients enrolled in the Korean trauma database from 1 January 2018 to 31 August 2021 were collected. The number of trauma centre visits, patient characteristics, factors associated with in-hospital intervention, and outcomes werecompared between patients in the two time periods. Propensity score matching was performed to analyse the outcomes in patients with similar characteristics and severitybetween patients in the two time periods.Results: The number of emergency department (ED) trauma service visits reduced in the COVID-19 era. Based on the mean age, the patients were older in the COVID-19 era. Abbreviated injury scale (AIS) 1, AIS3, AIS5, and injury severity score (ISS) were higher in the COVID-19 era. The proportion of motor vehicle collisions decreased, whereas falls increased during the COVID-19 era. Ambulance transportation, admission to the general ward, and time from injury to ED visit significantly increased. Patient outcomes, such as hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and duration of mechanical ventilation improved, while injury severity worsened during the COVID-19 era. After adjusting for patient characteristics and severity, similar findings were observed.Conclusion: The small reduction in the number of trauma patients and visits by patients who hadhigher ISS during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of maintaining trauma service capacity and capability during the pandemic. A nationwide or nationalmulticentre study will be more meaningful to examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the changes in trauma patterns, volume, and patient outcomes.

Background: Cancer mostly affects older adults, causing a wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. One of the most important moments in cancer patients is the hospitalization period, in which older patients usually remain bedridden for many hours and this may lead to the appearance of sarcopenia and disability. Methods: We present the research protocol for a randomized controlled trial that will analyze whether an intervention applied to older patients (≥ 65 years) who are hospitalized for acute medical conditions in an Oncology Department improves function. A total of 240 hospitalized older patients will be recruited in the Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, and they will be randomized. The intervention consists of a multicomponent exercise training program that will take place for 4 consecutive days (2 sessions/day). The control group will receive usual hospital care, which will include physical rehabilitation when needed. The primary end point will be the change in functional capacity from baseline to hospital discharge, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary end points will be changes in cognitive and mood status, quality of life, fatigue, strength (dynamic and handgrip), pain, nutrition, length of stay, falls, readmission rate and mortality at 3 months after discharge. Results: Basal data of the patients included in the RCT are described. The foreseen recruitment will not be achieved due to the context of the Covid pandemic and the significantly different responses observed during the clinical trial in oncogeriatric patients compared to our previous experience in older adults hospitalized for medical reasons. Discussion: If our hypothesis is correct and shows that a multicomponent, individualized and progressive exercise program is an effective therapy for improving the capacity of acutely hospitalized older patients compared to usual care, a change in the current system of hospitalization may be justified in oncogeriatric patients.

• This project supports early nutritional evaluation and intervention for older adult patients after major orthopedic procedure. Participants who received early intervention had improved outcomes. • Assessment of pre-albumin on admission to rehabilitation. • Functional outcomes. • Length of stay. • Readmission to hospital. • Discharge to home. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of early nutritional assessment and nutritional intervention on outcomes of older adult patients after discharge from an acute care hospital following fall related fracture. This was a feasibility pilot study with post intervention data. One group pretest-posttest study design was implemented. All participants were admitted to a rehabilitation facility in the Southwestern US after a fall related fracture. Discharge destination, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and length of stay (LOS). A total of 69% of the participants were discharged home. Total FIM scores improved (p<0.01). No significant association was identified between prealbumin change and total FIM change. Patients who had improved prealbumin experienced improved FIM and shorter LOS; however, no significant correlations were determined between LOS and prealbumin change. Nutritional interventions are important for recovery during rehabilitation of a fall-related fracture. This project supports early nutritional evaluation and intervention for older adult patients after major orthopedic procedure. Participants who received early intervention had improved outcomes.

Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. Background: Recent publications indicate that blunt solid organ injuries can be safely managed with reduced length of stay using pathways focused on hemodynamics. We hypothesized that pediatric patients with isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries may be safely discharged after brief observation with appropriate outpatient follow-up. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the need for admission of pediatric trauma patients with isolated low-grade solid organ injury resulting from blunt trauma. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of trauma registry data from 2011 to 2018 to identify isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries among children younger than 19 years. "Complication or intervention" was defined as transfusions, transfer to the intensive care unit, repeat imaging, decrease in Hgb greater than 2 g/dl, fluid bolus after initial resuscitation, operation or interventional radiology procedure, or readmission within 1 week. Results: A total of 51 patients were admitted to the trauma service with isolated Grade I or II blunt solid organ injuries during the 8-year study period. The average age was 11 years. Among isolated Grade I or II injuries, seven (14%) had "complication or intervention" including greater than 2 g/dl drop in Hgb in four patients (8%), follow-up ultrasonography for pain in one patient (2%), readmission for pain in one patient (2%), or a fluid bolus in two patients (4%). None required transfusion or surgery. The most common mechanism of injury was sports related (45%), and the average length of stay was 1 day. Conclusion: Among a cohort of 51 patients with isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries, none required a significant intervention justifying need for admission. All "complication or intervention" patients observed were of limited clinical significance. We recommend that hemodynamically stable patients with isolated low-grade solid organ injuries may be discharged from the emergency department after a brief observation along with appropriate instructions and pain management.

Admission Blunt abdominal trauma Pediatric Solid organ injury Trauma SDC T Pediatric trauma remains the leading cause of death and disability in children 1–18 years of age, with approximately six million children being injured in 2018 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020b). The total medical cost is upward of 27 trillion dollars a year for all fatal and nonfatal injuries among children. Although prevention is the primary method to reduce pediatric injury, limiting unnecessary interventions or hospitalizations when safe is also important. Abdominal injuries, predominately solid organ injuries (SOIs) including liver, spleen, and kidney, account for approximately 10%–15% of pediatric traumatic injuries annually in the United States (Davies, Pearl, Ein, Langer, & Wales, 2009). The care of pediatric patients with blunt SOI has evolved over the last two decades, and nonoperative management is currently the gold standard for treatment. This approach was first proposed by Stylianos (2000) and the American Pediatric Surgical Association Trauma Committee in 2000. Given the demonstrated success of this approach, with less than 5% failing nonoperative management at pediatric trauma centers, there has been recent interest in continuing to push forward care paradigms for these patients (Arbra et al., 2017; Spijkerman et al., 2020). Historically, these patients have had standard hospital lengths of stay (LOSs) based on grade of SOI, but more recently, there has been growing interest in safely reducing hospital LOS among nonoperatively managed patients. Such guidelines would use clinical symptoms and signs to drive care rather than grade of injury, as detailed in recent recommendations by the American Pediatric Surgical Association and the Arizona–Texas–Oklahoma–Memphis–Arkansas Consortium (Gates et al., 2019; Notrica et al., 2015; Walsh, Schmit, & Yanchar, 2017). These guidelines support more rapid advancement of diet, reduced bed rest time, reduced laboratory testing, and a more expeditious discharge for those patients who remain clinically well. Grade I and II injuries are the mildest forms of SOI with observed rapid recovery, resulting in patients reaching discharge criteria within 24 hr. There is, however, a paucity of literature regarding whether these patients can be safely discharged from the emergency department (ED) without inhospital admission and treatment. Two recent publications by Dodgion et al. (2014) and Plumblee et al. (2020) suggest that there may be opportunities to safely avoid hospital admissions for some children with isolated SOIs. Building upon these initial reports, we sought to evaluate in more detail how often patients with isolated Grade I or II SOIs require an intervention or experience a complication that would justify the need for hospitalization. We hypothesized that pediatric patients with isolated Grade I or II SOI would rarely require an intervention or suffer a complication necessitating hospital admission. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the need for admission of pediatric trauma patients with isolated low-grade SOI resulting from blunt trauma. METHODS: An 8-year retrospective cohort review of trauma registry data was conducted from 2011 to 2018 to identify isolated blunt SOIs in children admitted to our American College of Surgeons–verified Level I pediatric trauma center. The trauma registry is a comprehensive registry that collects data on all injured patients admitted to the hospital. Inclusion criteria included children 18 years of age and younger with a blunt mechanism of injury and a diagnosis code of a Grade I or II SOI of the liver, spleen, or kidney (see Supplemental Digital Content, available at: http://links.lww.com.sladenlibrary.hfhs.org:2048/JTN/A34). We excluded those patients with a penetrating mechanism. The cohort was divided into two groups, those with no concurrent injuries (isolated) beyond minor bruises, contusions, and lacerations, and those who had concurrent injuries such as fractures, mild traumatic brain injury without intracranial findings, and thoracic injuries. Both groups were chosen on the basis of the possibility that such patients could potentially be discharged from the ED after a short period of observation. Data collected from the trauma registry included patient age, hospital admission and discharge dates, mechanism of injury, ICD-9 or ICD-10 code with corresponding diagnosis, grade of SOI, ED LOS, intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, total hospital LOS, interventions performed, and intervention location. Grade of SOI was classified at the time of initial evaluation on abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic scan by our pediatric radiologists based on The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grading scale (AAST, 2020). Patient records were evaluated to identify complications or interventions using trauma registry data and chart review. "Complication or intervention" was defined as requiring an ICU stay, operating room or interventional radiology procedure, blood product transfusions, intravenous fluid bolus after ED resuscitation, repeat imaging, drop in hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than 2 g/dl at any time during hospitalization, or readmission within 1 week of discharge date. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were summarized as means and standard deviations. This study was determined to be exempt by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Nearly 4,000 patients were admitted to our trauma service over an 8-year period from 2011 to 2018, and a total of 96 patients were identified as having a low-grade (I or II) SOI of kidney, liver, or spleen. At the time of this study, our institution used an SOI guideline for management of admitted patients based on grade of injury. Fifty-one patients had isolated injuries, and 45 patients had concurrent injuries. The mean age was 11.4 years, with 70% being males. Eighty-two percent had an LOS of less than 2 days, and 11% were admitted to the ICU. Among the isolated injury cohort, the most common solid organ injured was the liver, followed by the spleen and kidney (48%, 35%, 17%, respectively; see Table 1). The most common mechanism of injury for those with isolated injuries was related to sports (45%). For those with concurrent injuries, the most common mechanism was motor vehicle crash (47%); see Figure 1A and 1B. Figure 1. (A) Mechanism of injury for isolated Grade I/II injuries.

When comparing those with isolated injuries and those with concurrent injuries, we found that 73% of those with isolated injuries had an LOS of 1 day and less compared with only 47% among those with concurrent injuries. The factors contributing to the longer LOS of patients with concurrent injuries included poor patient progression to regular diet, timing of early a.m. admissions, delay in establishing safe discharge plan with social work collaboration, need for tertiary imaging for other injuries, tachycardia requiring fluid bolus, and further renal imaging due to ongoing hematuria (see Table 1). Of the 51 patients with an isolated Grade I or II injury, seven (14%) experienced a "complication or intervention." Of the 27 patients with isolated Grade I injuries, two (7%) had a "complication or intervention," whereas, in the 24 patients with an isolated Grade II injury, five (21%) had a "complication or intervention." The most common "complication or intervention" was a drop in Hgb greater than 2 g/dl in four (8%) patients. Of this cohort (n = 3 [6%]), the spleen was the most common organ associated with "complication or intervention." Patient "complication or intervention" and details are described further in Table 2. TABLE 2 "Complications or Interventions" in Isolated Solid Organ Injury Patients: Isolated Grade I (N = 27) Explanation Isolated Grade II (N = 24) Explanation N (%) N (%) Repeat imaging 1 (3.7) Ongoing gross hematuria, urology consulted and renal ultrasonography showing perinephric hematoma and area of decreased perfusion, no intervention 0 (0) Decrease in hemoglobin >2 g/dl 1 (3.7) No repeat CBC and no interventions 3 (12.5) One patient with multiple rechecks but not clear whether given bolus due to this (same patient as a fluid bolus) Two patients with subsequent CBC improved, no intervention Readmission within 1 week 0 (0) 1 (4.2) Readmit for pain 5 days after prior DC due to LUQ pain and pallor, repeat CT of abdomen Hemoglobin stable, observed and DC home 2 days later (same patient as ICU admission patient) Fluid bolus after ED 0 (0) 2 (8.3) Due to low UOP and tachycardia, bolus 2× Bolus 1× due to unclear reason (no tachycardia; same patient as in patient with decreased Hgb) ICU admission 0 (0) 1 (4.2) ICU for close abdominal examinations for possible bowel injury due to free fluid (same patient as readmit patient) Blood transfusion 0 (0) 0 (0) OR/IR procedure 0 (0) 0 (0) Note. CBC = complete blood count; CT = computerized tomography; DC = discharge; ED = emergency department; Hgb = hemoglobin; ICU = intensive care unit; IR = interventional radiology; LUQ = left upper quadrant; OR = operating room; UOP = urinary output. Among the four patients with isolated SOI and an Hgb drop of greater than 2 g/dl, only one patient received an intervention (fluid bolus times two) on hospital Day 1 and 2 for associated decreased urine output and tachycardia concerning dehydration with good response. It was felt that the drop in this patient's hemoglobin could have been related to hemodilution. None of the four patients with a drop in Hgb greater than 2 g/dl received a blood transfusion. If the three patients with a drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit who required no intervention were removed, the overall number of "complication or intervention" for those with isolated Grade I or II injuries would drop to four (8%). Upon review of patients with low-grade SOIs and concurrent injuries, including mild traumatic brain injury, thoracic injury, and fractures, the incidence of "complication or intervention" increased to 36% overall, with 12 (42%) with Grade I injuries and 11 (33%) with Grade II injuries. The most common "complication or intervention" was a drop in Hgb greater than 2 g/dl and was noted in 12 (52%) patients in the concurrent injury group. The liver was the most common organ associated with "complication or intervention" and was identified in five (11%) patients. Among the 12 patients with SOI and concurrent injuries with an Hgb drop of greater than 2 g/dl, six patients received an intervention including packed red blood cells transfusion or fluid bolus. Our institution has no mandatory requirement for transfusion; rather, the decision for transfusion is based on clinical status of the patient and a guideline of transfusion for Hgb less than 7 g/dl or ongoing signs or symptoms of bleeding. Four patients required ICU admission, whereas six patients did not require any intervention or ICU care. If the six patients with an Hgb drop who did not require intervention or ICU care were removed, there would be a decrease to 17 (22%) patients with a "complication or intervention" for Grade I or II injuries with concurrent injuries (see Table 3).

DISCUSSION: Grade I and II SOIs are considered minor injuries that rarely require intervention. The vast majority of those with isolated injuries require hospitalization for less than 1 day. Among those with such isolated low-grade injuries, the need for an intervention—fluid bolus post-ED resuscitation for tachycardia, repeat imaging for gross hematuria, ICU admission for close, and serial examinations secondary to concern for bowel injury—occurred in only 8% of patients. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider discharge from the ED in isolated SOI patients after a short observation period in the absence of persistent tachycardia, ongoing abdominal pain concerning a bowel injury, or gross hematuria. If it is deemed safe to discharge from the ED, this could impact the health care costs and safely allow patients to recover at home. Given the higher rate of required intervention for those with concurrent injury, this group still likely benefits from admission with observation. Among our cohort of patients with an isolated SOI, the average ED LOS was approximately 4½ hr. Given that 59% of children who fail nonoperative management of an SOI do so in the first 4 hr after presentation, this would seem adequate for an observation period prior to discharge among those with isolated low-grade injuries (Acker, Petrun, Partrick, Roosevelt, & Bensard, 2015). Those with concurrent injuries had a higher need for interventions, which is in line with prior studies (Dodgion et al., 2014; Plumblee et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2017). Although none of the patients in our study required a transfusion, others have demonstrated an increased need for transfusion among those with SOIs associated with concurrent injuries (Plumblee et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2017). Among those with isolated minor SOIs, more than 70% stayed in the hospital for less than 1 day. Prior studies have also demonstrated the median LOS for similar cohorts to be 2 or fewer days. They also demonstrated a reduced need for narcotics in this group (Walsh et al., 2017). Although most patients with isolated low-grade SOI could likely be safely discharged after a 4-hr observation period in the ED, there are key aspects that should prompt admission for observation. Such factors include any hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin, or need for early transfusion. In our cohort of isolated injuries, only one patient had tachycardia after admission, and none required transfusion at any time. Based upon our observations, patient admission should be considered if there is gross hematuria or any clinical signs or symptoms of possible associated bowel injury. Finally, given the higher rate of interventions for those with concurrent injuries, these patients should continue to be admitted for observation. This work also demonstrates the potential to reduce transfers from regional or adult centers to pediatric trauma centers for patients with isolated low-grade SOIs. Further collaboration with regional centers would enable those centers to complete full workups and provide care via telehealth consultation with the pediatric institutions in lieu of transfer in stable patients who meet criteria. LIMITATIONS: Our study is not without limitations. First, the retrospective nature of data collection may result in a "complication or intervention" not being completely included in our trauma registry data. Second, the small sample size of patients with isolated Grade I and II SOIs does not allow full exploration of all types of patients who may suffer these injuries and possible complications. Although our single-center study is limited by small sample size, the findings align and build upon other published work on this topic. Third, our choice of complications and interventions was based on our clinical expertise and experience and not an established measure. It is, therefore, possible that we have not captured interventions that others may find important. Given our broad definition, including any fluid bolus, a drop in hemoglobin without intervention, and readmission for pain, we believe that our criteria were very conservative. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study adds further clarity to the literature supporting the safety of a period of limited ED observation without the need for admission for children with isolated low-grade SOIs from blunt mechanisms of trauma. Further prospective studies with close follow-up of those discharged will be an important future step in ensuring the safety of this approach. KEY POINTS: Isolated solid organ injury in pediatric patients resulting from blunt trauma can be managed most of the time nonoperatively. Isolated Grade I or II (low-grade) solid organ injuries rarely require interventions. Isolated Grade I or II solid organ injuries may be safely treated without inpatient admission decreasing medical costs, burden to patient and family, and overall patient care. REFERENCES: Acker S. N.

Tools for Effect of an additional health‐professional‐led exercise programme on clinical health outcomes after hip fracture.

Effect of an additional health‐professional‐led exercise programme on clinical health outcomes after hip fracture.
By:Beckmann, Monica;Bruun‐Olsen, Vigdis;Pripp, Are Hugo;+3 moreIn:Physiotherapy Research International, Apr2021, volume 26, issue 2, pages 1-10 (10p)CINAHL
Purpose: To examine the effect of an additional 2‐week health professional‐led functional exercise programme compared to usual care for patients after hip fracture during a short‐term nursing home stay directly after hospital discharge. Method: One hundred and forty participants, 65 years or older with hip fracture, admitted to a short‐term nursing home stay were randomised to an intervention group or control group. Participants in the intervention group (n = 78) received the experimental programme consisted of functional exercises, performed by health care professionals up to four times a day, 7 days a week, in addition to usual care during a 2‐week short‐term nursing home stay. Participants in the control group (n = 62) received usual care alone. Primary outcome was Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes were Timed Up & Go, New Mobility Score, The University of California, Los Angeles Activity Scale, Fall Efficacy Scale International, The EuroQol five dimension five‐level questionnaire, and Numeric Rating Scale for pain. Outcome measures were assessed after 2 weeks in a short‐term nursing home stay and 3 months after hip fracture surgery. The activity monitor ActivPal registered activity during the 2‐week short‐term nursing home stay. Results: No statistically significant differences between groups was found in any outcomes after 2 weeks or 3 months (p > 0.05). There were statistically significant within‐group improvements in primary outcome SPPB and in most secondary outcomes at all time points in both groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions: A 2‐week health professional‐led functional exercise programme in addition to usual care demonstrated no difference in clinical outcomes compared to usual care alone up to 3 months after hip fracture. The patients with hip fracture are fragile and vulnerable in this early phase, and usual physiotherapy may be sufficient to improve their physical function.

Tools for A Service Evaluation of Acute Neurological Patients Managed on Clinically Inappropriate Wards.

A Service Evaluation of Acute Neurological Patients Managed on Clinically Inappropriate Wards.
By:Holmes, Richard J.;Stratford, SophieIn:Journal of Clinical Outcomes Management, May2021, volume 28, issue 3, pages 139-143 (5p)CINAHL
Objective: Despite the benefits of early and frequent input from a neurologist, there is wide variation in the availability of this service, especially in district general hospitals, with many patients managed on clinically inappropriate wards. The purpose of this service evaluation was to explore the impact this had on patient care. Methods: A retrospective service evaluation was undertaken at a National Health Service hospital by reviewing patient records over a 6-month period. Data related to demographics, processes within the patient's care, and secondary complications were recorded. Findings were compared with those of stroke patients managed on a specialist stroke ward. Results: A total of 63 patients were identified, with a mean age of 72 years. The mean length of stay was 25.9 days, with a readmission rate of 16.7%. Only 15.9% of patients were reviewed by a neurologist. There was a high rate of secondary complications, with a number of patients experiencing falls (11.1%), pressure ulcers (14.3%), and health care-acquired infections (33.3%) during their admission. Conclusions: The lack of specialist input from a neurologist and the management of patients on clinically inappropriate warns may have negatively impacted length of stay, readmission rates, and the frequency of secondary complications.

Tools for Predictors of Inappropriate Helicopter Transport.

Predictors of Inappropriate Helicopter Transport.
By:Brown, Christopher;Irfan, Wajeeh;Schoen, Jonathan E.;+8 moreIn:American Surgeon, Feb2021, volume 87, issue 2, pages 248-252 (5p)CINAHL
Background: Helicopter transport (HT) is an efficient, but costly, means for injured patients to receive life-saving, definitive trauma care. Identifying the characteristics of inappropriate HT presents an opportunity to improve the utilization of this finite medical resource.Methods: Trauma registry records of all HT for a 3-year period (2016-2018) to an urban Level I trauma center were reviewed. HT was defined as inappropriate for patients who were discharged home from the emergency department or had a hospital length of stay <1 day, and who were discharged alive. Chi-square analysis and Student's t-test were used for univariate analysis. Predictors with a P value of less than .15 were subject to binary logistic regression analysis. A P value ≤.05 was considered significant.Results: There were 713 patients who received HT during the study period. One-hundred and forty-eight (20.8%) patients met the criteria as an inappropriate HT. In univariate analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale >8, Shock Index <0.9, and fall mechanism were found to be significantly associated with inappropriate HT. Age >55 was found to be associated with an appropriate HT. The average Injury Severity Score of the inappropriate HT group was 3.86 (±3.85) compared with 16.80 (±11.23) (P = .0001, Student's t-test).Discussion: Our findings suggest that there are evidence-based predictors of patients receiving inappropriate HT. Triage of HT using these predictors has the potential to decrease unnecessary deployments and reduce health care costs.

Tools for Shared electric scooter injuries admitted to Auckland City Hospital: a comparative review one year after their introduction.

Shared electric scooter injuries admitted to Auckland City Hospital: a comparative review one year after their introduction.
By:McGuinness, Matthew J;Tiong, Yvonne;Bhagvan, SavithaIn:New Zealand Medical Journal, 02/19/2021, volume 134, issue 1530, pages 21-29 (9p)CINAHL
Aim: E-scooters were introduced to New Zealand in 2018 as a means of city transport. Since their introduction, their use has resulted in high injury rates. No studies have directly compared e-scooters to other forms of transport.Method: The Auckland City Hospital trauma registry was retrospectively searched for patients admitted with an e-scooter injury. A comparison group of patients admitted with an injury secondary to cycling during the same period was collected.Results: 178 patients were identified: 69 with e-scooter injuries and 109 with injuries sustained while cycling. The hospitalisation rate for e-scooter injuries was 326 hospitalisations per million hours. There was a significant difference found in blood ethanol levels (18.6 vs 6.4% positive, p-value=0.01), mechanism of injury (isolated falls: 87 vs 60.6%), time of injury (55.1 vs 40.4% between 5pm-8am) and protective gear use (worn in 10.1 vs 78.9%). No differences were found in injury severity, ICU admissions, length of stay or mortality.Conclusion: This study demonstrates a concerningly high e-scooter-related hospitalisation rate and suggests e-scooters are currently not as safe as cycling. Strategies to improve e-scooter safety are needed and could include zero tolerance for alcohol, mandatory protective gear, restricted operating times and changes in road laws.

Tools for Reducing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection: The Impact of Routine Screening in the Geriatric Hip Fracture Population.

Reducing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection: The Impact of Routine Screening in the Geriatric Hip Fracture Population.
By:Singh, Shridevi;Angus, L. D. George;Munnangi, Swapna;+5 moreIn:Journal of Trauma Nursing, Sep/Oct2021, volume 28, issue 5, pages 290-297 (8p)CINAHL
Background: Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a noted complication among geriatric hip fracture patients. This complication results in negative outcomes for both the patients and the institution providing care. Screening measures to identify predisposing factors, with early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) present on admission, may lead to reduced rates of CAUTI. Objective: The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of UTI on admission among geriatric hip fracture patients and whether routine screening for UTI or predisposing factors at presentation resulted in reduced rates of CAUTI. Methods: A retrospective observational study of geriatric hip fracture patients from January 2017 to December 2018 at a Level I trauma center was performed. Rates of UTI on admission and CAUTI were calculated using routine admission urinalysis. Results: Of the 183 patients in the sample, 36.1% had UTI on admission and 4.4% of patients developed CAUTI. There were no significant differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, and complications between those with UTI on admission and those without. Conclusions: Urinary tract infection on admission may be present among a large portion of geriatric hip fracture patients, leading to increased rates of CAUTI. Routine screening for UTI and its predisposing factors at admission can identify these patients earlier and lead to earlier treatments and prevention of CAUTI.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections CAUTI Complications Elderly Geriatric Hip fracture Hospital costs Trauma Urinary tract infections INTRODUCTION: Geriatric hip fracture patients are susceptible to a higher rate of complications, with rates ranging from 7% to 40% (Bliemel et al., 2017; Różańska, Wałaszek, Wolak, & Bulanda, 2016; Thakker et al., 2018). One such complication is catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Risk factors inherent to this population include surgical procedures, immobility, age, and the routine utilization of indwelling urinary catheters in the perioperative period (Detweiler, Mayers, & Fletcher, 2015; Hälleberg Nyman et al., 2013; Zielinski et al., 2015). This complication negatively impacts both the patient and the institution providing care. It is reported that 15.5% of hospitalized patients older than 65 years have urinary tract infections (UTIs) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019; Foxman, 2010). Moreover, 6.2% of infectious disease-related deaths are due to UTIs (Alpay, Aykin, Korkmaz, Gulduren, & Caglan, 2018). Implementation of various measures has led to a reduction in the incidence of UTIs; however, UTIs are still prevalent, placing an enormous financial burden on institutions (Polites et al., 2014; Rebmann & Greene, 2010). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid has deemed that CAUTI is a "reasonably preventable" inhospital complication and has terminated reimbursements for these events since 2008 (CDC, 2019). The mean cost of UTI is $862 to $1007 per UTI (Bail et al., 2015; CDC, 2019; Scott, 2010), whereas a systematic review found that the mean cost of CAUTI can exceed $10,000 per CAUTI based on the clinical status of the patient (Hollenbeak & Schilling, 2018). A vast majority of patients who suffer hip fractures undergo a surgical repair after admission (Bliemel et al., 2017; Johnstone, Morgan, Wilkinson, & Chissell, 1995; Wallace et al., 2019). These repairs have an elevated risk of causing postoperative urinary retention due to the use of anesthesia, patient immobility, and long duration of surgery (Johnstone et al., 1995; Polites et al., 2014; Rowe & Juthani-Mehta, 2013). It is also common practice at some institutions, including our own, to routinely place an indwelling urinary catheter for bladder drainage during the perioperative period (Bliemel et al., 2017; Hälleberg Nyman et al., 2013). Geriatric trauma patients are a unique patient population with numerous intrinsic risk factors for UTI (Bohl et al., 2017; Magill et al., 2014; Monaghan et al., 2011). Some of these risk factors include female sex, falls, head injury, and altered mental status (Aubron et al., 2012; Bliemel et al., 2017; Zielinski et al., 2015). Elderly patients tend to be institutionalized with lower mobility or have medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, stroke, or dementia that predispose these patients to bladder or bowel incontinence and UTI (Foxman, 2014; Mody & Juthani-Mehta, 2014; Woodford & George, 2009). In addition, less attention to sanitary precautions further predisposes this specific patient population to high rates of UTIs (Alpay et al., 2018). Although current guidelines do not recommend treating asymptomatic bacteriuria (Zalmanovici Trestioreanu, Lador, Sauerbrun-Cutler, & Leibovici, 2015), this specific population subset may not be able to vocalize or validate symptoms due to altered mental status and communication incapability as a result of dementia, stroke, etc. (Tsuda et al., 2015). Hence, we presume that in this specific patient population, UTI is a missed diagnosis because of the missed clinical correlation needed as per current UTI diagnostic criteria guidelines (CDC, 2019; Rowe & Juthani-Mehta, 2014). Failure in early diagnosis and treatment in this specific elderly patient population results in morbid outcomes for patients and significant financial penalties for institutions (Detweiler et al., 2015; Thakker et al., 2018; Zielinski et al., 2014). However, the question arises whether a CAUTI diagnosis is truly the progression of asymptomatic bacteriuria due to the indwelling catheter or is rather a result of comorbid UTI at admission. Therefore, we propose that by screening geriatric hip fracture patients with a urinalysis (UA) within 24 hr of an indwelling urinary catheter that is placed at admission, we will find there is a significant frequency of patients who present with either UTI on admission or with UA findings that could predispose patients to a UTI with an indwelling urinary catheter. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of patients at an urban Level I trauma center, as verified by the American College of Surgeons, was performed. The trauma center is a 500-bed public safety-net hospital that serves 1.4 million people, with approximately 75,000 emergency department visits and approximately 1,700 trauma admissions each year. After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board (19-205), the trauma registry was queried by using ICD-10 codes S72.001-S72.26 for hip fracture for all patients 65 years and older from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018, which were the first 2 years that routine screening UA was included as a component of the multidisciplinary geriatric hip fracture comanagement protocol at this institution (Wallace et al., 2019). Routine screening UAs were obtained within 24 hr of admission. Demographic information, comorbid conditions, preinjury medications, mechanism of injury, vital signs, Abbreviated Injury Score, Injury Severity Score, Revised Trauma Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, admission disposition, hospital course, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, complications, disposition, and outcome were extracted from the trauma registry supplemented by direct review of the electronic medical record. Initially, 193 patient records were identified. However, 10 of these patient records were deemed incomplete and were excluded, as they either did not have at least one of the above data points available or the screening UA performed, leaving 183 patients for the final sample. There was no historical control group, as the frequency of UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria at the time of admission were the variables of interest. All patients were admitted to the ICU as part of our institution's protocol for geriatric hip fracture patients. Urinary tract infection is a clinical diagnosis with symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, or suprapubic pain. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is defined as a UTI in the setting of an indwelling urinary catheter that has been in place for more than 2 consecutive days in an inpatient location, with the catheter being present either the day of UTI diagnosis or removed the day before (CDC, 2021). Urinalysis can be used as a diagnostic tool to reinforce the clinical diagnosis of a UTI with positive results for leukocyte esterase or nitrites in a midstream-void specimen (Schulz, Hoffman, Pothof, & Fox, 2016; Simati, Kriegsman, & Safranek, 2013; Stovall et al., 2013). Leukocyte esterase is specific (94%–98%) and sensitive (75%–96%) for detecting uropathogens equivalent to 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml of urine (Devillé et al., 2004; Nicolle et al., 2005; Simati et al., 2013). Negative nitrite tests do not rule out a UTI because the causative organism can also be non-nitrate-reducing (e.g., Enterococci species, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Acinetobacter species). Therefore, the sensitivity of nitrite tests ranges from 35% to 85%, but with a specificity of 95% (Devillé et al., 2004; Nicolle et al., 2005; Simati et al., 2013). Nitrite tests can also be falsely negative if the urine specimen is too diluted (Devillé et al., 2004; Nicolle et al., 2005; Simati et al., 2013). In addition, microscopic hematuria may be present in 40%–60% of patients with UTI (Devillé et al., 2004). The diagnosis of UTI in this study was made based on the following UA results regardless of clinical symptoms: white blood cells >10/high-power field (hpf), +nitrites, +bacteria. Comparisons of outcomes were then compared to subgroups within the data collected. Patients diagnosed with UTI were treated with antibiotics. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical variables in the study sample. Continuous variables were summarized by presenting mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency and percentages. The study sample was stratified into two groups based on whether or not the patient had a UTI upon admission. Continuous variables were compared using unpaired Student's t-test. The Fisher exact test or Pearson χ2 test was used to examine the association of categorical variables with UTI on admission. A p value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 183 hip fracture patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of these 183 patients, 36.07% had a UTI on admission, and 63.93% did not. Table 1 depicts the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics of the study sample stratified by the UTI status upon admission. The average age of the patients was 84.9 years (M = 84.9, SD = 8). The majority (76.5%) were female. Fall from the same level was the most common mechanism of injury (77%). The mortality rate was 4.4%. Advance directives were in place for 8.2% of the patients. The median ICU length of stay was 3 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 1), and median hospital length of stay was 4 days (IQR = 4). Overall, eight patients, or 4.4% of the study sample, had CAUTI, six of whom were female. A Foley catheter was in place for a median of 2 days (IQR = 1). Acute rehabilitation was the most common discharge disposition (49.7%). There was a statistically significant increase in median ICU length of stay in those with UTI on admission compared with those without. All other demographic and clinical characteristics did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the two groups.

DISCUSSION: The elimination of all CAUTI is not attainable; however, it is necessary to take "reasonable preventive" measures to mitigate this inhospital complication that also has a significant financial burden on institutions. By ceasing reimbursements for hospital-acquired UTI, there has been a reduction in UTI rates (CDC, 2019). Yet, there is still a significant prevalence of hospital-acquired UTIs that is burdensome to the host institution (Chenoweth, Gould, & Saint, 2014; Gould et al., 2010; Hassan, Tuckman, Patrick, Kountz, & Kohn, 2010). This study looked at a specific patient population with two important characteristics that deem them at high risk for UTI at admission or postadmission: age and fractured hip. This study aimed to assess the frequency of a positive UA at admission in elderly hip fracture patients, which was found to be 36%. Bliemel et al. (2017) found that 24% of their elderly hip fracture patients sustained an inhospital UTI. The patients in Bliemel et al.'s study were assessed with a UA and urine culture after indwelling catheter removal in those who had clinical symptoms specific for UTI or diffuse symptoms of fatigue, fever, or weakness (Bliemel et al., 2017). In our study, we screened and treated patients based on UA results at admission as per our inhospital protocol for elderly hip fractures. By doing so, rates of CAUTI may have been reduced. In our study period, eight of 183 (4.4%, Table 4) patients developed CAUTI during their hospital course, and 66 of 183 (36%, Table 1) patients had UTI on admission. The increased incidence of CAUTI seen in previous studies compared to our data supports the theory that the colonization of urine with bacteria might have already been present and untreated. It is generally recommended that patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, and for the nonelderly hip fracture patient, we agree. The limitation in obtaining symptomatology history in this specific patient population due to their comorbidities (e.g., dementia) and the significant incidence of positive UA at admission in this study supports the theory that the clinical diagnosis of UTI should be assessed objectively and thus treated appropriately in elderly hip fracture patients.

Study Limitations: The retrospective design of the study is a limitation in itself. Our data were collected by analyzing medical records, which intrinsically lends itself to systematic bias. The validity of data relating to such things as laboratory values and interpretation can therefore not be fully guaranteed. Our sample size was also small, and we hope to elaborate with future studies. However, as a pilot study, we believe that publishing our findings will engage the academic community and help determine future study parameters. Furthermore, as a descriptive, observational study, there are limitations as there are no control groups, and interpretation of results is therefore theoretical. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we strongly believe that if an admission UA was conducted for elderly hip fracture patients and positive results were treated accordingly, there would be a significant reduction in the diagnosis of CAUTI. An indwelling urinary catheter is commonly placed in elderly hip fracture patients, increasing their inherent risk for a UTI based on catheter placement alone. This study has also demonstrated the increased incidence of positive UA as an additional theoretical risk factor for CAUTI in these patients. Because of potential for serious complications, mortality, and financial burden on institutions, early identification of urinary tract infection or asymptomatic bacteriuria should be identified and treated in a protocolized manner in elderly hip fracture patients. These protocols can lower the incidence of CAUTI and improve outcomes in this susceptible and high-risk population. Although routine screening for urinary tract infection is a common measure adopted in geriatric wards, it has not been common practice among elderly trauma patients. This article brings forward the need to adopt this common practice to reduce the likelihood of a CAUTI being attributed to institutions, given the high risk of infection/colonization in the geriatric population. Therefore, we recommend that all elderly hip fracture patients be screened at admission with a UA and be treated appropriately. KEY POINTS: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a well-known complication among the geriatric hip fracture population. CAUTI has negative consequences for both the patient and the institution and may be due to urinary tract infection (UTI) present on admission. This study observed outcomes in geriatric hip fracture patients who underwent routine UTI screening on admission. The results of this study suggest reduced rates of CAUTI compared to previously published literature. The results suggest there may be a role in routine UTI screening for geriatric hip fracture patients.

Tools for Individual Pharmacotherapy Management (IPM) - I: a group-matched retrospective controlled clinical study on prevention of complicating delirium in the elderly trauma patients and identification of associated factors.

Individual Pharmacotherapy Management (IPM) - I: a group-matched retrospective controlled clinical study on prevention of complicating delirium in the elderly trauma patients and identification of associated factors.
By:Drewas, Luise;Ghadir, Hassan;Neef, Rüdiger;+2 moreIn:BMC Geriatrics, 06/01/2022, volume 22, issue 1, pages 1-18 (18p)CINAHL
Background: Delirium is one of the most frequent complications in hospitalized elderly patients with additional costs such as prolongation of hospital stays and institutionalization, with risk of reduced functional recovery, long-term cognitive impairment, and increased morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the effect of individual pharmacotherapy management (IPM) in the University Hospital Halle in geriatric trauma patients on complicating delirium and aimed to identify associated factors.Methods: In a retrospective controlled clinical study of 404 hospitalized trauma patients ≥70 years we compared the IPM intervention group (IG) with a control group (CG) before IPM implementation. Delirium was recorded from the hospital discharge letter. The medication review and data records included baseline data, all medications, diagnoses, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory and vital parameters during hospitalization. The IPM internist and the senior trauma physician guaranteed personnel and structural continuity in the implementation of the interdisciplinary patient rounds.Results: There was a highly matched congruence between CG and IG in terms of age, gender, residency, BMI, most diagnoses, and injury patterns to compare the two groups. The total number of medications per patient was 11.1 ± 4.9 (CG) versus 10.4 ± 3.6 (IG). Our targeted IPM focus on 6 frontline aspects with reduction of antipsychotics, anticholinergic burden, benzodiazepines, serotonergic opioids, elimination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions and overdosage reduced complicating delirium from 5% to almost zero at 0.5%. The association of IPM with a significant 10-fold reduction, OR = 0.09 [95% CI 0.01-0.7], in univariable regression, maintained of clinical relevance in multivariable regression OR = 0.1 [95% CI 0.01-1.1]. Factors most strongly associated with complicating delirium in univariable regression were cognitive dysfunction, nursing home residency, muscle relaxants, antiparkinsonian agents, xanthines, transient disorientation documented in the fall risk scale, antibiotic-requiring infections, antifungals, antipsychotics, and intensive care stay, the two latter maintaining significance in multivariable regression.Conclusions: IPM is associated with a highly effective prevention of complicating delirium in the elderly trauma patients. For patient safety it should be integrated as an essential preventative contribution. The associated factors help identify patients at risk.

Tools for Association Between Hyperoxemia and Increased Cell-Free Plasma Hemoglobin During Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Infants and Children.

Association Between Hyperoxemia and Increased Cell-Free Plasma Hemoglobin During Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Infants and Children.

Objectives: To determine potential risk factors for severe hemolysis during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass and examine whether supraphysiologic levels of oxygen and cardiopulmonary bypass duration are associated with hemolysis.Design: Prospective observational study.Setting: Cardiac ICU in a university-affiliated children's hospital.Patients: Greater than 1 month to less than 18 years old patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery.Interventions: None.Measurements and Main Results: Plasma samples from 100 patients to assess cell-free plasma hemoglobin levels were obtained at start cardiopulmonary bypass, at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, and 2 and 24 hours after reperfusion. Arterial blood gas samples were obtained before and every 30 minutes during cardiopulmonary bypass. Patient demographics and laboratory data were collected from the electronic medical record. Plasma hemoglobin levels peaked at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and haptoglobin levels continued to fall throughout all time points. There were 44 patients with severe hemolysis (change in cell-free plasma hemoglobin > 50 mg/dL). Younger age (odds ratio/sd 0.45 [95% CI, 0.25-0.81]) and higher mean Pao2 × cardiopulmonary bypass duration (31.11 [1.46-664.64]) were identified as risk factors for severe hemolysis in multivariable analysis. Severe hemolysis was associated with longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay as well as acute kidney injury.Conclusions: We observed younger age and the exposure to both oxygen and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass as risk factors for hemolysis. Oxygen delivery through the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is an easily modifiable risk factor. Its role in the production of reactive oxygen species that could alter the erythrocyte membrane deserves further examination in larger prospective studies.

797 IMPROVING GERIATRIC CARE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT; TREATT PROJECT: THE RAPID EARLY ASSESSMENT THERAPY TEAM...British Geriatrics Society Abstracts from the Autumn Meeting (Virtual), November 24-26, 2021.
By:Foxley, H;Colby, C;Swin, J;+1 moreIn:Age & Ageing, 2022 Supplement 1, volume 51, issue suppl_1, page 1 (1p)CINAHL
Introduction At University Hospital Southampton (UHS) on average 400 elderly patients attend the emergency department (ED) each month following a fall with an estimated cost to the NHS of £2.3 billion a year. 50% of over 80's fall at least once a year, after a first fall, 2/3 will fall again within the year. Since the creation of the Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC), treatment of those attending ED with frailty conditions has improved. However, the current therapy service cannot adequately assess these patients, leading to longer length of stay (LOS) and suboptimal functional outcomes. An initial 3-month pilot in ED identified those seen by a therapist had a reduced LOS compared with those who did not receive therapy (6.9 days vs 8.5 days). The data identified that 253 patients presenting later in the day received a substandard service. Methods An extended hours trial across a 2-month period was conducted. During this period therapists provided a proactive, responsive service to support comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) in ED. Data was collected including demographics, diagnosis, response time, interventions, community referrals and LOS. The key outcome measures identified within the pilot were LOS, reduction in 1 night hospital stays, appropriate onward referrals, readmission rates and CGAs including falls reviews. Results This improvement project is in progress and the trial will be completed August 2021. The key areas for analysis will be LOS, readmission rates and the impact of early frailty assessments on discharge destination and admission avoidance. Conclusion With the aging population and local demographics in West Hampshire and Southampton city, frailty conditions are increasing. The demand on ED outweighs the current therapy service. The trial aims to avoid multiple admissions following falls, improve patients' outcomes through reduced LOS and ensure appropriate referrals are made to ensure continuity of care into the community.

The impact of the Mexico-San Diego border wall extension on spine injuries: a retrospective cohort review.
By:Tenorio, Alexander;Brandel, Michael G;Produturi, Gautam R;+4 moreIn:Journal of Travel Medicine, Oct2022, volume 29, issue 7, pages 1-6 (6p)CINAHL
Background: The recent San Diego-Mexico border wall height extension has resulted in an increased injury risk for unauthorized immigrants falling from greater heights. However, the effects of the border wall extension on frequency and morbidity of spinal injuries and related economic costs have yet to be highlighted.Methods: We retrospectively compared two cohorts who presented to the UC San Diego Health Trauma Center for border wall falls: pre-height extension (12 patients; January 2016-May 2018), and post-height extension (102 patients; January 2020-December 2021). Patients presented during border wall construction (June 2018-December 2019) were excluded. Demographics, clinical data and hospital costs were collected. Spinal injuries were normalized using Customs and Border Protection apprehensions. Costs were adjusted for inflation using the 2021 medical care price index.Results: The increase in spine injuries per month (0.8-4.25) and operative spine injuries per month (0.3- 1.7) was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Increase in median length of stay from 6 [interquartile range (IQR) 2-7] to 9 days (IQR 6-13) was statistically significant (P = 0.006). Median total hospital charges increased from $174 660 to $294 421 and was also significant (P < 0.001).Conclusion: The data support that the recent San Diego-Mexico border wall extension is correlated with more frequent, severe and costly spinal injuries. This current infrastructure should be re-evaluated as border-related injuries represent a humanitarian and public health crisis.

Introduction: We aimed to describe the prevalence and pattern of maxillofacial trauma in Qatar. Methods: This is a retrospective study of trauma registry data at Hamad General Hospital during the period from January 2011 to December 2014. The study included all traumatic maxillofacial patients who underwent CT scan and were admitted during the study period. Results: A total of 1187 patients with maxillofacial injuries were included in the study and 18.5% of all trauma admissions were related to maxillofacial injuries. Young age and males were predominantly affected. Mechanisms of injury were mainly traffic-related and fall. Orbital injuries were the commonest followed by maxillary injuries. The median and range face abbreviated injury score (AIS) was 2 [1–3] with 66% had a score of 2. Maxillofacial fractures were frequently associated with traumatic brain injuries. One out of five patients was managed with surgery and had median length of stays in ICU and hospital 5 and 7 days, respectively. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 8.3%. Mortality in isolated maxillofacial was low (0.3%) in comparison to 15% in polytrauma patients (p = 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that Injury Severity Score, face AIS and Glasgow Coma Scale were predictors of mortality with age-adjusted odd ratio of 1.15, 2.48 and 0.82; respectively. Conclusions: Maxillofacial trauma requiring admission is not uncommon in our trauma center and mostly it is mild to moderate in severity. Associated injuries are present in most of the maxillofacial injured patients and further diagnostic investigations should be part of the assessment in maxillofacial injuries.

Tools for Characterizing rescue performance in a tertiary care medical center: a systems approach to provide management decision support.

Characterizing rescue performance in a tertiary care medical center: a systems approach to provide management decision support.
By:McGrath, Susan P.;MacKenzie, Todd;Perreard, Irina;+1 moreIn:BMC Health Services Research, 08/20/2021, volume 21, issue 1, pages 1-12 (12p)CINAHL
Background: Allocation of limited resources to improve quality, patient safety, and outcomes is a decision-making challenge health care leaders face every day. While much valuable health care management research has concentrated on administrative data analysis, this approach often falls short of providing actionable information essential for effective management of specific system implementations and complex systems. This comprehensive performance analysis of a hospital-wide system illustrates application of various analysis approaches to support understanding specific system behaviors and identify leverage points for improvement. The study focuses on performance of a hospital rescue system supporting early recognition and response to patient deterioration, which is essential to reduce preventable inpatient deaths.Methods: Retrospective analysis of tertiary care hospital inpatient and rescue data was conducted using a systems analysis approach to characterize: patient demographics; rescue activation types and locations; temporal patterns of activation; and associations of patient factors, including complications, with post-rescue care disposition and outcomes.Results: Increases in bedside consultations (20% per year) were found with increased rescue activations during periods of resource limitations and changes (e.g., shift changes, weekends). Cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and sepsis complications present the highest risk for rescue and death. Distributions of incidence of rescue and death by day of patient stay may suggest opportunities for earlier recognition.Conclusions: Specific findings highlight the potential of using rescue-related risk and targeted resource deployment strategies to improve early detection of deterioration. The approach and methods applied can be used by other institutions to understand performance and allow rational incremental improvements to complex care delivery systems.

Tools for Mortality analysis of hospitalized trauma patients in the intensive care unit.

Mortality analysis of hospitalized trauma patients in the intensive care unit.
By:Duran, Mehmet;Uludağ, ÖznurIn:Journal of Surgery & Medicine (JOSAM), 2020, volume 4, issue 11, pages 994-997 (4p)CINAHL
Aim: Trauma accounts for around five million deaths a year and constitutes a serious threat to public health globally. We examined the characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to trauma in 2015 and investigated the mortality rate and affecting factors. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the data of 101 trauma patients who were followed up at the general ICU in Adıyaman University Training and Research Hospital between January 2015 and December 2015 were analyzed. Patients' demographic data, regions and causes of trauma, hospitalization durations, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, whether blood products were transfused, mechanical ventilation support, operations, and duration of stay in ICU were noted. We then divided the patients into two groups as survivors and non-survivors and examined the mortality rates and the effective factors. Results: Mortality rates of the patients were 15.8%. The mean age of the patients included in the study was 30.73 (25.188) years. Among all, there were 71 males and 30 females. The most common causes of trauma were in-vehicle traffic accidents (33.7%), falls (28.7%) and extravehicular traffic accidents (24.8%). The patients were often admitted to the ICU because of head trauma. The ICU length of stay was significantly higher in the non-survivor group compared to the discharged group (12.81 (23.49) vs. 3.78 (2.84) days, P<0.001), along with the duration of mechanical ventilation (2.49 (8.85) vs. 0.74 (1.30), P<0.001). GCS scores at admission were significantly lower in the non-survivor group (5.88 (3.12) vs. 11.98 (2.70), P<0.001). Conclusion: Direct exposure to trauma as a pedestrian, duration of mechanic ventilation, and low GCS scores during admission increase mortality in patients admitted to the ICU due to trauma.

The value of sepsis biomarkers and their kinetics in the prognosis of septic shock due to bacterial infections.

Background: In this study, we aim to explore the value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum cholinesterase (SChE) activity kinetics as useful predictors of mortality in patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We conducted a prospective single-blinded study in the ICU of a university hospital during a period of 1 year. Were included all patients 18 years of age or older, with confirmed septic shock. For all included patients, blood samples of septic biomarkers (PCT, SChE activity, and CRP) were obtained. Serum was collected at the day of ICU admission (day 0), the day of septic shock (day 1), then 3 and 5 days after the septic shock development. Results: During the study period, 60 patients were included. The mean age (± SD) was 47.7 ± 19 years. There were 46 male (74%) and 14 female (26%) patients. Mean SAPSII on ICU admission was 40.7 ± 16 (median: 37), and mean SOFA score on ICU admission was 16 ± 4 (median: 7). During their ICU stay, out of the 60 included patients, 37 patients died (61%). The comparison between the 2 groups (deaths and survivors) showed that the factors associated with poor outcome were age, SOFA score on ICU admission, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The day of septic shock, there was no difference in the mean concentrations in those of plasma SChE activity or in the PCT and CRP plasma between survivors and non-survivors. However, the comparison of mean plasma SChE activity, and PCT and CRP plasma concentrations (on day 3 and day 5) between survivors and non-survivors, showed a significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Our study suggests that, in a group of critically ill patients with severe septic shock, a rise or no change in procalcitonin and/or CRP level, and/or a decrease or no change in SChE activity should warn the clinician about the insufficiency and/ or inadequacy of the therapy. However, a fall in procalcitonin and/or CRP levels, and/or a rise in SChE activity were associated with a favourable prognosis. Based on our study and some other data detailed above, we recommend that an estimation of SChE activity, procalcitonin, and CRP on the day of septic shock, followed by estimation within the next 72--120 h, could help the prognostic assessment of critically ill patients with septic shock. Further studies are needed to define the critical values related to mortality.

Tools for Exercise Intervention and Hospital-Associated Disability: A Nonrandomized Controlled Clinical Trial.

Exercise Intervention and Hospital-Associated Disability: A Nonrandomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
By:Rodriguez-Lopez, Carlos;Mayordomo-Cava, Jennifer;Zarralanga-Lasobras, Teresa;+7 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 08/02/2024, volume 7, issue 2, page e2355103CINAHL
Key Points: Question: Is an in-hospital exercise and health education intervention associated with a reduced incidence of hospital-associated disability in older adults? Findings: In this nonrandomized controlled clinical trial of 260 patients, a multicomponent exercise program combined with health education was not associated with significant reductions in the incidence of hospital-associated disability in older patients receiving acute hospital care when assessed by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living. Meaning: These results suggest that incorporation of this intervention in the care plan of hospitalized elderly patients is not associated with a lower incidence of hospital-associated disability if it is only assessed by the Katz Index. This nonrandomized controlled clinical trial assesses the association of a multicomponent exercise intervention combined with a health education program with the incidence of hospital-associated disability in hospitalized older patients. Importance: Inpatient exercise interventions may prevent, at least partly, hospital-associated disability (HAD) in older adults, but whether they also confer clinical benefits in the months following discharge is unclear. Objective: To examine the association of exercise and health education with HAD incidence in hospitalized older adults receiving acute hospital care at discharge and 3 months later. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center open-label, nonrandomized controlled clinical trial included patients aged 75 years or older seen at an acute care for elders unit at a tertiary public hospital in Madrid, Spain, from May 1, 2018, to June 30, 2022. Interventions: Patients were allocated to an intervention or control group. Both groups received usual care, but the intervention group also performed a supervised multicomponent exercise program (daily strength, balance, and walking exercises along with inspiratory muscle training) during hospitalization and received health education on how to exercise at home and telephone counseling during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was HAD incidence (determined by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living [hereafter, Katz Index]) at discharge and after 3 months compared with baseline (ie, 2 weeks before admission). Secondary outcomes included HAD incidence determined by the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living, ambulatory capacity decline at discharge and follow-up, changes in physical performance at discharge, and incidence of falls, readmissions, and mortality during the follow-up period. Results: The study included 260 patients (134 women [51.5%]; mean [SD] age, 87.4 [4.9] years [range, 75-105 years]; median hospital length of stay, 7 days [IQR, 5-10 days]), of whom 130 received the intervention and 130 were in the control group. Differences in HAD incidence did not reach statistical significance at discharge (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05; P =.08) or follow-up (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.36-1.17; P =.15) when using the Katz Index. A lower HAD incidence was observed in the intervention group at discharge (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.81; P =.01) and at follow-up (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.66; P =.001) when using the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living. The intervention was also associated with a lesser decline in ambulatory capacity (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96; P =.03) and improved physical performance at discharge (Cohen d, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-0.65; P =.004). No significant associations were observed for readmissions, falls, or mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this nonrandomized controlled clinical trial, an exercise and health education intervention was not significantly associated with reduced HAD incidence when measured by the Katz Index. However, the benefits found for several secondary outcomes might support the implementation of in-hospital exercise programs for older patients.

Tools for Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Employment and Educational Outcomes of Individuals in a First-Episode Psychosis Clinic.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Employment and Educational Outcomes of Individuals in a First-Episode Psychosis Clinic.
By:Szmulewicz, Alejandro;Öngür, Dost;Shinn, Ann K.;+6 moreIn:Psychiatric Services, Feb2022, volume 73, issue 2, pages 165-171 (7p)CINAHL
Objective: A central objective of early psychosis therapy is to restore social functioning (e.g., through employment and education). Employment and educational outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined in a well-defined cohort of patients receiving care in an early psychosis clinic.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 128 patients receiving care at McLean Hospital's first-episode psychosis (FEP) clinic between January 1 and September 21 in 2019 and 2020. Using a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and robust standard errors, the authors compared the average changes in the weekly employment and education proportions before and after COVID-19 lockdowns with the same changes in 2019.Results: Employment losses among patients with FEP were greater than among the general population and persisted through the end of follow-up. In 2020, average employment after a stay-at-home order was instituted was 33% lower than before the order compared with the change in employment during the same period in 2019. The effect was stronger among men and those who identified as non-White, were age <21 years, or did not have a college education. Although educational engagement recovered in the fall of 2020, it still remained below the 2019 levels.Conclusions: Employment disruptions were major and persistent among the FEP population, which might affect short- and long-term outcomes. Innovative approaches are needed to help patients transition to remote employment, file unemployment claims, and use online hiring platforms to ameliorate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early detection of functional limitations remains an important goal to prevent disability in individuals who have been hospitalized. To examine the association between versions of the bed bridge test (BBT), a new functional test to assess hospitalized patients, and post-hospitalization outcomes such as return to work, death, readmission and falls in individuals after six months of discharge. This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective study, in which 92 hospitalized patients eligible for the study performed in random order o BBT: 5 repetitions (BBT5R) and 10 repetitions (BBT10R), 30 seconds (BBT30sec) and 60 seconds (BBT60sec). Sociodemographic data, diagnosis, comorbidities, and length of stay were recorded. Six months after hospital discharge, telephone contact was made and information was obtained on return to usual/work activities, rehospitalization, falls, functional independence, and the patient's vital status. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed. The independent variables were gender, age, comorbidities, length of stay, and performance on the BBT versions. The dependent variables were usual/work activities, rehospitalization, falls, functional independence, and death. Linear regression models were used to determine whether the BBT versions and sociodemographic variables predict return to usual/work activities, rehospitalization, falls, functional independence, and death. The participants (50.9±17.2 years old, 60% women) included in the study were composed of 66% with clinical condition and 34% with surgical condition. All versions of the BTT were associated with age and FSS comorbidity (rs=-0.50 to -0.20 and 0.28 to 0.43; p<0.05 for all). Only BBT30s (rs=0.28) and BBT60s (rs=0.37) were directly associated with returning to usual/work activities. There was no association between the BBT versions and the other dependent variables. Patients who resumed their usual/work activities performed better in BBT30s and BBT60s when compared to those who did not resume their activities (BBT30s = 19 ± 6 vs 15 ± 3.5 repetitions, p = 0.007; and BBT60s = 35 ± 11 vs 30 ± 5.4; p=0.015). Lower comorbidity score, female gender, and better performance on the BBT60s were independent predictors of higher return to work, explaining 40% of the variation. This study demonstrated a modest association between return to work 6 months after discharge and better performance on the BBT60s during hospitalization, including lower scores for comorbidities and female sex. This relationship should be interpreted with caution and confirmed in future studies. The BBT60s is a simple, quick, and useful way to include hospitalized people in the follow-up. This study allows us to present suggestions for future studies. Thus, it is suggested to continue investigating whether the BBT can be used as a predictor of other outcomes.

Tools for IMPACT OF HEMOGLOBIN ON ONCOLOGY PATIENT FALLS...47th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress, April 27–May 1, 2022, Anaheim, CA

IMPACT OF HEMOGLOBIN ON ONCOLOGY PATIENT FALLS...47th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress, April 27–May 1, 2022, Anaheim, CA
By:Shuey, Kathleen;Ellis, Teri;Tellson, AlainaIn:Oncology Nursing Forum, Mar2022, volume 49, issue 2, page E164CINAHL
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality indicates that approximately 700,000 to 1 million falls occur in US hospitals annually. On average, there are 3 to 5 falls per 1000 patient days. A review of the literature identified a multitude of studies addressing risk factors and prevention tactics. In oncology, disease, treatment, and treatment side effects can place a patient at a greater risk of fall. Treatment can lead to a decreased hemoglobin. Patients may not realize the impact that treatment or cancer has had predisposing the patient to increased risk of a fall. Additionally, not all patients who have a low hemoglobin on the oncology units fall. A literature review did not identify studies in the oncology patient population that examined the impact of hemoglobin on fall rates. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine clinical factors that impact hospitalized oncology patients with a low hemoglobin that fall versus hospitalized oncology patients with a low hemoglobin that do not fall. A retrospective chart review will be performed. The study population will consist of a convenience sample of oncology patients hospitalized on three inpatient oncology units from July 2019 through June 2021. All patients that fall during the identified time frame will be included in the sample. A group of patients matched by age (± 5 years), diagnosis, and unit location that did not fall during the same time frame will serve as a comparison group. The non-fall group will be matched 2:1 to the fall group. Hemoglobin and fall risk will be evaluated on admission, 24-48 hours prior to fall and closest to the time of fall. Additional data to be evaluated includes cancer diagnosis, treatment, secondary diagnoses, length of stay, functional mobility, and medications administered during the hospitalization. Sample characteristics will be described using descriptive statistics. Evaluation of data will include us of frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, chi-square test, two-sample t-test and logistic regression model. In a population that consists largely of hematology patients, most are admitted with or develop a low hemoglobin. Not all patients who have a low hemoglobin fall. This study may identify additional risk factors that would identify which patients with a low hemoglobin have an increased risk of falls.

Tools for Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the patterns of vital signs recording and staff compliance with expected monitoring schedules on general wards.

Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the patterns of vital signs recording and staff compliance with expected monitoring schedules on general wards.
By:Kostakis, Ina;Smith, Gary B;Prytherch, David;+4 moreIn:Resuscitation, Jan2021, volume 158, pages 30-38 (9p)CINAHL
Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) placed increased burdens on National Health Service hospitals and necessitated significant adjustments to their structures and processes. This research investigated if and how these changes affected the patterns of vital sign recording and staff compliance with expected monitoring schedules on general wards.Methods: We compared the pattern of vital signs and early warning score (EWS) data collected from admissions to a single hospital during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with those in three control periods from 2018, 2019 and 2020. Main outcome measures were weekly and monthly hospital admissions; daily and hourly patterns of recorded vital signs and EWS values; time to next observation and; proportions of 'on time', 'late' and 'missed' vital signs observations sets.Results: There were large falls in admissions at the beginning of the COVID-19 era. Admissions were older, more unwell on admission and throughout their stay, more often required supplementary oxygen, spent longer in hospital and had a higher in-hospital mortality compared to one or more of the control periods. More daily observation sets were performed during the COVID-19 era than in the control periods. However, there was no clear evidence that COVID-19 affected the pattern of vital signs collection across the 24-h period or the week.Conclusions: The increased burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the alterations in healthcare structures and processes necessary to respond to it, did not adversely affect the hospitals' ability to monitor patients under its care and to comply with expected monitoring schedules.

"Safer at home": The effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on epidemiology, resource utilization, and outcomes at a large urban trauma center.
By:Chiba, Hiroto;Lewis, Meghan;Benjamin, Elizabeth R.;+6 moreIn:Journal of Trauma & Acute Care Surgery, Apr2021, volume 90, issue 4, pages 708-713 (6p)CINAHL
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire global health care system. In California, because of a high burden of cases, a lockdown order was announced on March 19, 2020. This study investigated the impact of the lockdown on the epidemiology and outcomes of trauma admissions at the largest trauma center in Los Angeles.Methods: A retrospective study comparing epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of trauma admissions during the lockdown period (March 20, 2020, to June 30, 2020) to a similar period in the previous year (March 20, 2019, to June 30, 2019) was performed. Data collection included demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital transportation, substance use, injury severity, resource utilization, and outcomes.Findings: There were 1,202 admissions during the lockdown period in 2020 and 1,143 during the same calendar period in 2019. Following the lockdown, there was a reduction in the automobile versus pedestrian admissions by 42.5%, motorcycle injuries by 38.7%, and bicycle accidents by 28.4% but no significant effect on the number of motor vehicle accident admissions. There was an increase in ground level falls by 32.5%, especially in the elderly group. The absolute number of gunshot wounds increased by 6.2% and knife injuries by 39.3%. Suicides increased by 38.5%. Positive testing for substance use increased by 20.9%. During the lockdown, patients suffered less severe trauma, with Injury Severity Score of <9 (p < 0.001), as well as less severe head (p = 0.001) and severe chest trauma (p < 0.001). Trauma deaths were reduced by 27.9%, and the crude overall mortality was significantly lower during the lockdown period (4.1% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.046). Intensive care unit admission rates, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit length of stay were all reduced.Conclusion: The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had a significant effect on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and critical care resource utilization of trauma admissions in a large academic trauma center. These findings may help in planning and optimization of hospital resources during the pandemic.Level Of Evidence: Epidemiological study, level III; Retrospective observational, level III.

Tools for Evaluation of Patients' Adverse Events During Contact Isolation for Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci Using a Matched Cohort Study With Propensity Score.

Evaluation of Patients' Adverse Events During Contact Isolation for Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci Using a Matched Cohort Study With Propensity Score.
By:Kang, JaHyun;Ji, Eunjeong;Kim, Junghee;+5 moreIn:JAMA Network Open, 10/03/2022, volume 5, issue 3, page e221865CINAHL
Key Points: Question: Is contact isolation associated with more adverse events among patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)? Findings: In this cohort study of 98 529 hospitalized adult patients in Korea, no significant difference was found in the incidence of falls and pressure ulcers among patients with VRE contact isolation compared with patients without contact isolation. Meaning: These findings suggest that contact isolation for patients with multidrug-resistant organisms should not be discouraged on the basis of concerns about a greater likelihood of unintended adverse events. This cohort study compares the incidence of adverse events between a contact isolation group with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and a matched comparison group using full electronic medical records of adults in Korea. Importance: Although contact isolation has been widely recommended for multidrug-resistant organisms, contact isolation has raised some concerns that it may bring unintended patient harms. Objective: To compare adverse events between a contact isolation group with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and a matched comparison group using a relatively large data set from full electronic medical records (EMR) and propensity score–matching methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, matched cohort study was conducted at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) in Korea, a tertiary, university-affiliated hospital that has 1337 inpatient beds. Participants included a total of 98 529 hospitalized adult patients (aged ≥18 years) during 2015 to 2017. Exposures: Contact isolation in a single or shared double room. Main Outcomes and Measures: As adverse contact isolation–related outcomes, falls and pressure ulcers were included. All relevant EMR data were extracted from the SNUBH clinical data warehouse. Risk factors for adverse events were included in the propensity score model based on literature reviews, such as Braden scale score and Hendrich II fall risk score. A fine stratification and weighting (FSW) and a 1:10 nearest neighbor (NN) propensity score matching as a sensitivity analysis were adopted to compare adverse events between the 2 groups for the observation period from the study entry date and the exit date. Time-to-event analyses with a Cox proportional hazard model were conducted in December 2021. Results: For comparison of outcomes in wards, 177 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.38 [14.12] years; 98 [55.4%] female) with VRE and 93 022 patients (mean [SD] age, 56.44 [16.88] years; 49 462 [53.2%] female) without VRE were included and no difference was found in basic characteristics from the FSW (VRE contact isolation [n = 172] vs comparison [n = 69 434]) as well as from the 1:10 NN (VRE contact isolation [n = 168] vs comparison [n = 1650]). Among 177 patients with VRE contact isolation, 8 pressure ulcers and 3 falls occurred during their hospital stays; incidence rates of adverse events were 2.5 and 0.9 per 1000 patient-days, respectively (pressure ulcer incidence rate from the FSW: 2.53 per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 1.09-4.99 per 1000 patient-days]; pressure ulcer incidence rate from the 1:10 NN: 2.54 per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 1.10-5.01 per 1000 patient-days]; fall incidence rate from the FSW: 0.87 per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 0.18-2.54 per 1000 patient-days]; fall incidence rate from the 1:10 NN: 0.87 per 1000 patient-days [95% CI, 0.18-2.55 per 1000 patient-days]). The hazard ratios for adverse events showed no statistically significant differences for both groups: 1.42 (95% CI, 0.67-2.99) for pressure ulcer and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.20-2.13) for fall from the FSW. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, no association was found between the likelihood of adverse events and contact isolation using propensity score–matching methods and closely related covariates for adverse events.

Tools for Inclusion of medication-related fall risk in fall risk assessment tool in geriatric care units.

Inclusion of medication-related fall risk in fall risk assessment tool in geriatric care units.
By:Michalcova, Jana;Vasut, Karel;Airaksinen, Marja;+1 moreIn:BMC Geriatrics, 06/11/2020, volume 20, issue 1, page N.PAGCINAHL
Background: Falls are common undesirable events for older adults in institutions. Even though the patient's fall risk may be scored on admission, the medication-induced fall risk may be ignored. This study developed a preliminary categorization of fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) to be added as a risk factor to the existing fall risk assessment tool routinely used in geriatric care units.Methods: Medication use data of older adults who had experienced at least one fall during a hospital ward or a nursing home stay within a 2-year study period were retrospectively collected from patient records. Medicines used were classified into three risk categories (high, moderate and none) according to the fall risk information in statutory summaries of product characteristics (SmPCs). The fall risk categorization incorporated the relative frequency of such adverse drug effects (ADEs) in SmPCs that were known to be connected to fall risk (sedation, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dizziness, drowsiness, changes in blood pressure or impaired balance). Also, distribution of fall risk scores assessed on admission without considering medications was counted.Results: The fall-experienced patients (n = 188, 128 from the hospital and 60 from nursing home records) used altogether 1748 medicaments, including 216 different active substances. Of the active substances, 102 (47%) were categorized as high risk (category A) for increasing fall risk. Fall-experienced patients (n = 188) received a mean of 3.8 category A medicines (n = 710), 53% (n = 375) of which affected the nervous and 40% (n = 281) the cardiovascular system. Without considering medication-related fall risk, 53% (n = 100) of the patients were scored having a high fall risk (3 or 4 risk scores).Conclusion: It was possible to develop a preliminary categorization of FRIDs basing on their adverse drug effect profile in SmPCs and frequency of use in older patients who had experienced at least one documented fall in a geriatric care unit. Even though more than half of the fall-experienced study participants had high fall risk scores on admission, their fall risk might have been underestimated as use of high fall risk medicines was common, even concomitant use. Further studies are needed to develop the FRID categorization and assess its impact on fall risk.

Tools for EP100 PRESSURE INJURY PREVENTION: CASE STUDY IN KING FAHD CENTRAL HOSPITAL - GIZAN...European Wound Management Association (EWMA) Conference, May 3-5, 2023, Milan, Italy

EP100 PRESSURE INJURY PREVENTION: CASE STUDY IN KING FAHD CENTRAL HOSPITAL - GIZAN...European Wound Management Association (EWMA) Conference, May 3-5, 2023, Milan, Italy
By:Alibrahim, AliIn:Journal of Wound Management, Jul2023, volume 24, issue 2, page 86 (1p)CINAHL
Aim: Study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a developed Standard Programme in preventing HAPUs. Method: This is a retrospective comparative study of pressure ulcer prevention Programme (PUPP) at single healthcare facility (ICU). The outcomes of PUPP were tracked for 1 year. The current project location was in King Fahad Central Hospital -- Jazan, a tertiary hospital with 450 beds located in Saudi Arabia. The average annual census in 2021 was 30,000 patients with 5.2 days average length of patient stay. Results / Discussion: Hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) remain a significant problem, despite implementation of numerous prevention initiatives. We aimed to assess the relationship between healthcare professionals' (nurses, residents, and attending physicians) perceptions of the importance of HAPU prevention and actual HAPU prevalence. Additionally, we were interested in their perception of the effectiveness of existing prevention initiatives and devices, as well as their satisfaction with the same. We hypothesized that perceptions of the importance of pressure ulcer prevention would be correlated with pressure ulcer prevalence. We also hypothesized that there would be high perceived effectiveness for, and satisfaction with, existing initiatives. A quality improvement project was initiated by the hospital administration to improve patient wound management through education and documentation of risk assessment. During fall of 2021, the nurse director, quality improvement nurse, clinical nurse educator, and wound care team including doctors, dietician, health educators, and infection control met to review the hospital pressure ulcer rates and the implemented practices. An initial assessment of the committee found that policy and procedure were incomplete and outdated, there was no protocol for general wound care and there was no complete wound care. Additionally, there was a shortage of proper beds and mattresses and heal protectors. A decision was made to commence PUPP looking at three categories. The first category was creating a wound care team; second was hospital staff education about PUPP; and third was continuous data collection and monitoring through frequent reporting. The initial aim was to reduce the PU rates in the hospital by 50% within the first 6 months of the Programme implementation. Conclusion: Despite an overall positive perception of the importance of pressure ulcer prevention, HAPUs continue to be a major problem. Contrary to our hypothesis, many current initiatives are felt to be effective. There was an effective correlation between perceptions on the importance of prevention and HAPU prevalence, suggesting that prevention methods are effective as thought or they are being used as widely as they should. Further research should take advantage of these positive attitudes by prospectively investigating novel interventions, especially in the ICU setting.

Introduction: University Health Network (UHN), a health system in Canada's largest urban centre, launched a new model of care to improve the care experience with a focus on integrating all aspects of care whether in or outside of a hospital. This Program is developed and delivered in partnership with VHA Home Healthcare as lead agency, home care provider, and collaborative partner to improve patient experience and outcomes. The Program launched rapidly with great results serving +13,000 patients. This presentation will share how trust, effective governance and leadership helped navigate challenges and partner with organizations, to transform how patient care is delivered. Aims Objectives Theory or Methods: Co-designed by patients and providers, the integrated care experience is seamless, including health and social supports. The Program addressed common patient and caregiver complaints with one: • Care team and primary contact • 24/7 support line • Digital health record • Integrated fund The success of this Program is rooted in the philosophy of "One Team" across all sectors from a care delivery and leadership standpoint. This provided the ability to break down barriers and improve communication and collaboration. Key objectives: improve the care experience, clinician satisfaction, quality outcomes and population health, including decreasing length of stay, readmissions and ED visits. Highlights or Results or Key Findings: The integrated delivery team includes patient/caregiver partners, acute, home & community and primary care, finance and data, and regional government bodies. Patients undergoing surgery and living with chronic complex conditions are in scope. The Program was live within four-months in Thoracic Surgery (June 2019). Established infrastructure and system-wide partnerships accelerated implementation to Chronic Heart Failure (spring 2020), COVID Care (spring 2020), and Vascular Surgery (fall 2020). The program has benefited +13,000 patients and early evaluation results indicate improvements in care experience and health system outcomes: 28% shorter length of stay, 48% lower 90-day ED risk, and 33% lower 90-day readmission risk (for the low needs care paths). The trust built among the "One Team", and strong governance allowed us to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape and expedite expansion to support vulnerable populations. During the pandemic, care paths were adjusted to ensure care continuity, while delivering improved outcomes and experiences. Conclusions: In less than two years +13,000 patients have benefited and new pathways continue to rollout. The Program continues to identify opportunities to develop partnerships and support shared decisionmaking across the health system. Ongoing efforts to evolve include expanding connections with community and social supports continue to be critical to success. Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations: The Program has expanded while navigating challenges posed by a restructuring of health care delivery and the pandemic. Through effective governance, leadership and strong partnerships, the program established a sustainable foundation for rapid growth. This includes breaking new ground in looking at opportunities where regional collaborative efforts may be supported.
