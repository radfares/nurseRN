# Notes:
# - The repository contains a vendored `libs/agno` package. You must ensure
#   Python can import it (see README notes below). Do not include `agno`
#   here because it is provided in `libs/` inside the repo.
# - The cookbook contains optional examples that reference many other
#   packages (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, pgvector, ddgs, yfinance, pypdf,
#   newspaper3k, lxml, etc.). Add them if you plan to run those examples.
