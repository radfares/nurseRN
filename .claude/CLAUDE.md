No code in this file
everything is time stamped and dated each single visit and after project completion
task and todo list
  a-clean up the folder
    b-organize the files
      c-put not esstinal files in a folder nested with folders in order
      e-create a file ONE call it the truth_file.md and there I want a full breakdown of what each folder and files within those folders do. For example data_template.xlsx is a file what is it what does it do and is it being used. The same for the rest.
Then I want you go through each agents code file by file 5 times each one and find how We can optimize them not to  produce basic outputs and if can not be speiclized then the whole project is trashed no excusess no other solutions. You are allowed to change the agents around but consider cost. I do not want anyting to change for now.
