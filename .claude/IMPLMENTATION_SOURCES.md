       * API: Yes, an API is available through its providers (e.g., EBSCOhost). If you have institutional access, you can use this API to integrate its powerful search capabilities directly into your agents. You would need to
         check with your institution's library for API credentials.
       * Relevance: Highest. This is the primary database for nursing.

   2. Cochrane Library:
       * Description: The world's leading resource for systematic reviews in healthcare. Cochrane Reviews are internationally recognized as the highest standard in evidence-based medicine.
       * Access: Many countries and institutions have national subscriptions, making it free at the point of use. Abstracts are always free.
       * API: Yes, Cochrane provides APIs for searching and retrieving its content, which is ideal for agents needing to find the highest quality evidence on a clinical topic. https://api.cochrane.org/api-docs/
         (https://api.cochrane.org/api-docs/)
       * Relevance: Very High. Essential for evidence-based practice research.

   3. ClinicalTrials.gov:
       * Description: A massive database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world. It's an invaluable resource for finding ongoing or completed clinical trials on any medical topic.
       * Access: Completely free and public.
       * API: Yes, it offers a robust public API to search for studies, check their status, and retrieve detailed information. https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api (https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api)
       * Relevance: Very High. Crucial for finding primary research and trial data.

   4. medRxiv / bioRxiv:
       * Description: As mentioned before, these are preprint servers for the health (medRxiv) and biological (bioRxiv) sciences. They are the best places to find cutting-edge research before it has undergone peer review.
       * Access: Free.
       * API: Yes, the API allows you to programmatically access the latest health research as it's published. https://api.biorxiv.org/ (https://api.biorxiv.org/)
       * Relevance: High. Excellent for agents that need to be aware of the very latest findings.

  These four sources provide a powerful and specialized foundation for any nursing or healthcare research agent.

✦ Thank you for the clarification. That makes perfect sense. You need resources
  specifically focused on healthcare, nursing, and clinical information.

  While PubMed is the top-tier source, here are more specialized and highly relevant
  options for your agents, centered on nursing and healthcare.
